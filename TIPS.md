# CAT

1) Go to the exam hall with a blank/empty mind. Expect the unexpected. Instead of planning, be prepared.
2)  Min Percentile -> 75%. [Good Colleges -> 85%]
3) Focus on overall percentile.
4) Prioritize any '2' sections which you are doing good.

## VARC

1) Attempt -> 16-17 questions -> Try to get 40+ marks. [Greens]
2) Have to do good as it is the 1st section.
3) 40+ Marks -> Either 2-3RC with 5-6VA questions OR 4RCs with 75% accuracy.
4) 4RCs -> 1RC(Hard), 2RC(Medium), 1RC(Easy).
5) 8 VA questions -> 2RCs [Marks wise]

### RC

1) Understand the main theme/point of the RC.
2) Read the RC questions properly and understand them before answering.
3) After reading an RC question, think/analyze about the question and what could be the potential answer to that question from the passage. Then read the **options** to the question.
4) 2/2 Rule -> Eliminate the '2' wrong options first and then check which is the correct option among the rest '2' options left. Now give a bit more time on these '2' options and find the correct option.
5) If not able to find which is the correct option, then try to find the differences among the '2' options left. Always go for differences.
