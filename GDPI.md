* Don't talk negatively about other students.
* '2' or few reasons why we should select you:-

1) The school is famous for it's academic rigor, it is clear from my academic record I have been able to do well academically. I am pretty sure that I would be able to take the academic rigor of this clg. [General]
2) This school values leadership/this school values strength of character, I have been the captain of my club's cricket team for 3yrs. I would been able to imbibe those qualities in the class also. [General]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48fc1c12-cdb1-4a8c-99c6-1ee7f2d1cb18)

3) When I was looking at the student breakup of the clg, I saw that 14% of the students had 0-2yrs of work experience. I have 6 months of work experience and as a result I can bring in my own insights to the class. [KIIT clg specific] [Clg specific]

* '2' reasons why not to select you:-

1) I saw that 25% of the students had atleast 1yr of work experience, me on the other hand have 6 months of work experience **may** face problems while discussing case studies, though I think that I can cover them sir. Yes, this **could/might** be a reason. [KIIT clg specific] [Clg specific]
2) This clg gets absolutely brilliant students and as I have slightly lower marks in class 12th that **could** be a reason why I **may** not be selected. [General]

* Explanation if there is gap in experience between companies?
> I was working and I was thinking of preparing for the entrance exams so that I can do my higher studies. At the end of 2022, my company gave me notice that from next month onwards I had to come to office. Their office was in Bangalore and I was living in Kolkata. After weighing my options, I decided that I will just resign from my job and persue my preparation of GATE exam full-time. That was not the best decision on my end definitely, I should have continued with my job. I was over my head as I was able to secure a job right after graduation and I thought I could do the same thing after I left my current job but that did not happen. It was a very bad decision/choice from my end and I completely own my mistake and it will never happen again.

> I am really passionate about cricket. I played in a cricket club from 5th grade to 9th grade. We regularly participated in many tournaments. We played against many school teams.  Nowadays, I usually go to the nearby playgrounds and play with the people who are playing cricket there on a daily basis. On the weekends, I usually try to organize a couple of matches with my friends. You are playing, enjoying, having fun as well as getting a good amount of physical exercise is also being done.
Another topic which intrigues me the most is currency collecting which is collecting currencies of various countries. Currencies can be new or old or both. My father introduced me to this topic as he had already been collecting currencies from his younger days. He gave me his collection and told me to do research about the currencies he had. After that I was instantly interested. Whenever I meet someone new, I ask them if they have some old currency they have if they are willing can I have them or when I learn about someone who will be visiting a foreign country, I always request them if possible could they bring me some currency of that country.  In 2023, I visited Nepal and I was able to get some of their currently used currencies.
