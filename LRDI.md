* We get 4 puzzles in LRDI and we have to solve it in 40mins. If we are able to solve **2** out of the **4** puzzles then we will easily get **99+ percentile**. [Logic] [Summary] [Strategy] [Planning]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c915299a-7407-4c18-80cf-e53c503fb351)

* Every puzzle normally has **5** questions.
* 4 * 5 -> 20 questions
* 20 * 3 -> 60 marks
* We need to get around **30** marks(25 to 30) to get **99+ percentile**. [Strategy] [Planning]

* For **7**, we will pick **1 coin** and we are left with **6 coins**. Chanchal will pick which ever no of coins be it **1, 2, 3 or 4**, we can pick **4, 3, 2, 1** no. of coins respectively so that there is **1 coin** left which she has to pick and thus **loose** the game. [Logic] [Explaination] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* For **8** also it is **same** as **7** only. In **8** we will pick **2** coins so that the opponent lands on **6** which is the **loosing** number. [Logic] [Explaination] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* **7 and 8** are **winning** nos for me.
* We have to make th opponent pick the last **1** coin left at the end. [Logic] [Explaination] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

* We want **9** as it is a **winning** number because on **9** we can pick **3** coins and the opponent will be at '6' which is a **losing** number. [Logic]
* '10' is the same as '9'.
* 10 - 4 -> 6
* 11 - 4 -> 7 -> winning no.
* 11 is a losing no.
* **Trap** is on the **loosing nos**.

* How many coins 'A' should pick to ensure his win? [Question]

> The aim is to drop the opponent in the trap/losing numbers. [Logic] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

* Controlling factor(CF) -> min + max -> 1 + 4 -> 5.
* Series -> 5K + 1. 
* k = 39
* 5K + 1 -> 5 * 39 + 1 -> 196.
* Table has **200** coins. It is starting with **A**, so **A** will take **'4'** coins and **'B'** will have **196** coins left. As **196** is a **losing number** so the opponent will always lose. [Logic] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

* If last coin is left, then that coin has to be picked up.
* 2 <= n <= 5.
* They are playing **alternately**.
* Min. we have to pick **'2'** coins in normal situation.
* So we have **'2'** consecutive losing numbers.
* We don't want **'1 and 2'**. They are losing numbers.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47de43ba-9f9c-4649-bf38-78304cdae9fa)

* We would want to pick **'3'** because we can take '2' coins and the opponent is left with '1' coin only. So, we will **win**.
* 3 -> winning no.
* We want from **3 to 7** coins, these are winning numbers.
* 7 - 5 -> 2 -> opponent will lose.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a1b914c-443d-4791-93e2-3d105f5519bb)

* 2 [Question] [Set]
* We need to **minimize** the **no. of weights** we are putting on the balance. That's asked in the **question**. [Logic] [**IMPORTANT**]

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/MBA/assets/54589605/e0d46bb1-0962-42f8-bfd7-559bc5db13e7)

* 3kg - 1kg -> 2kg.
* 3 - 1 -> 2kg difference we have created.
* We can use the **difference** in the **weights**. [Logic] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* We have to put as **less weight** as possible.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/MBA/assets/54589605/ca0b6f15-0277-4614-a1d9-6a28f200f5d9)

* To measure '1kg' we will keep a '1kg' stone on one of the sides of the balance.
* To measure '2kg' we will keep '3kg' on one side and '1kg' on the other side of the balance. So the difference(3-1 -> 2) is '2kgs'.
* To measure '3kg' we will keep a '3kg' stone on one of the sides of the balance.
* To measure '4kg' we will keep a '3kg and 1kg' stone on one of the sides of the balance. So the sum(3 + 1 -> 4) will be '4kgs'.
* If we have **1kg and 3kg** stones then we can weight upto **4kgs**. [**IMPORTANT**]
* Now we can't measure '5kg' stone.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/MBA/assets/54589605/46e18d8e-ae8d-4331-94a7-8ff378f0b658)

* Instead of taking a '5kg' stone, we will take try to get the '5kg' by doing **difference** from both the sidess.
* 3 + 1 -> 4kg.
* 9 - 4 -> 5kg.
* If we have **9Kg** weight on one side and we put **1kg and 3kg** weights on the other side then the **differene** in the **weight** is **9 - (3+1) -> 9 - 4 -> 5kg**. This is how we will get **5kg**. We do not need a **5kg** weight.
* The difference is '9kg'.
* With the '9kg' stone we can measure '5kgs'.

* To use **min./minimize** the no. of **stones/weights** then we have to **maximize** the **value** of the stones. [Logic] [**IMPORTANT**]
* We have to put high value on the weights. We are maximizing the **weights**.
* With the weights of '1,3 and 9' we can measure upto a max. sum of **13kgs**.
* 9 + 3 + 1 -> 13kgs.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/MBA/assets/54589605/764d5c7b-af51-47c2-8771-e96d45f7d3ce)

* Put '9 and 3' on one side and '1' on the other side, so the difference will be '11kgs'.
* (9 + 3) - 1 -> 11kgs.
* Put '9' on one side and '3' on the other side, so the difference will be '6kgs'.
* 9 - 3 -> 6kgs.
* Put '9 and 1' on one side and '3' on the other side, so the difference will be '7kgs'.
* (9 + 1) - 3 -> 7kgs.
* * Put '9, 3 and 1' on one side and the sum will be '13kgs'.
* Max is '13kgs.
* We now we need to measure '14kgs'.

* 4 + 5 -> 9kgs.
* Instead of taking a '14kg' stone, we will take try to get the '14kg' by doing **difference** from both the sides. So we will take a '27kg' stone.
* 27 - 13 -> 14kgs.
* 13 + 14 -> 27kgs

* 5 [Question] [Set] [Doubt]
* We need to find some middle ground.
* For the 7days of work, the carpenter wants '140g' of gold as payment. Which means for every day's work, we have to give him '20g' of gold.
* 20 * 7 -> 140g.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d42da3ba-475e-474e-b489-4e8bf1cda856)

* On 1st day we had to cut '20g' from the gold biscuit and gave it to the carpenter for 1st day's work.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba09daf3-3645-4541-b8d5-6d7ca5d87cfb)

* On 2nd day, the carpenter would return 1st day's '20g' of gold and we would cut a '40g' piece from the gold biscuit and gave it to the carpenter for 2nd day's work.
* We are minimizing the no. of cuts.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d5bed2d-8544-49bb-9ce9-32fd48951631)

* On 3rd day, we would return the '20g' of gold the carpenter returned to us on day '2'. So at the end of day '3' the carpenter is having '40 + 20 -> 60g' of gold. 

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab579b6c-8ade-4a9e-b294-28a2e7ea9fb0)

* On 4th day, the carpenter would return the '20g + 40g' of gold and we would give the carpenter the '80g' piece of gold for 4th day's work.
* We didn't cut any pieces.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9b0a6c0-0e5e-4d6c-b84a-0cd20dfd86ae)

* On 5th day, the carpenter already had the '80g' of gold from the previous day and we would give the carpenter the '20g' piece of gold for 5th day's work.
* 80 + 20 -> 100g.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acb433ab-20ac-461b-b533-8e9a5f3dd397)

* On 6th day, the carpenter already had the '80 + 20g' of gold from the previous day, the carpenter would return the '20g' piece of gold and we would give the carpenter the '40g' piece of gold for 6th day's work.
* 80 + 40 -> 120g.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b65c7bd5-04bd-453b-a56f-1adbe227f827)

* On 7th day, the carpenter already had the '80 + 40g' of gold from the previous day, we would give the carpenter the '20g' piece of gold for 7th day's work.
* 80 + 40 + 20 -> 140g.

* Question.
* We got '10' weights of flowers. Why '10'?
* We have '5' different groups of flowers.
* We are weighing the flowers in groups of '3'.
* nCr -> 5C3 -> 10.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffadc83f-efac-4f13-aaa0-90a229cbfd4f)

* Each equation has '3' variables and we have '10' equations. So we will have '3 * 10 -> 30' variables.
* We have '5' different variables which means '30/5 -> 6'. So each variable is getting repeated '6' times.
* We want '5' equations.
* 6 * 5 -> 30.
* 1272.

* a + b + c + d + e = 212kg [Example]
* if, a + b + c = 106
* then, d + e = 212 - 106 = 106.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/517dd7ab-9fcd-46d7-880a-1370ddb61cdc)

* a + b + d = 116.
* a + b = 66
* d = 116 - 66 -> 50kg.
* d + e = 106
* e = 106 - 50 = 56kg.

* If the **middle** number is the **avg.** of the other '2' nos. then those nos. are in AP series. [Formula] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55e28601-5ba7-40ef-aaaa-819f03d5b534)

* d =50, e= 56, c= 40, a= 30, b= 36.
* We can see that **a,c and d** are in **AP** series.
* a,c, d -> 30 40 50.
* We know that tuberose is '40' because it is said in the **question** that tuberose is the avg. of tulips and hydrangeas. [Logic]
* tuberose -> 40
* We don't know if tulip is 30 or 50.
* We don't know if hydrangeas is 30 or 50.
* In the question, it is mentioned that hydrangeas is heavier than freesia but lighter than orchid. [Logic]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce91dd19-ff6e-46d6-9874-7f965cc8ea4f)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ee5f9bc-3ced-49b5-9fda-a0be0b902032)

* hydrangeas cannot be '30kgs' because it is mentioned that hydrangeas is heavier than freesia but '30kg' is not heavier than any other flower.
* So, the tupils is '30kgs' which is 'a'.
* It also means that tulips cannot be '50kgs' so hydrangeas is '50kgs' which is 'd'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dff18410-fc85-4798-8a6c-891d0b3c90be)

* As '56' is lighter than hydrangeas which is '50kgs' and it is mentioned that hydrangeas is lighter than orchid.
* So, orchid is '56kgs' which is 'e'.
* So the last freesia is '36kgs' which is 'b'.

* 7 [Question] [Set]
* With '1' cut we cannot give every number, so we will start thinking about **atleast '2' cuts**.
* Within the whole interlocking of 'n', we are doing '2' random cuts.
* If we are doing '2' cuts then we will get '2' rings of '1g' each. We will get '2' rings of '1g' each.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47b01254-5286-4f3b-8825-7bdb39f06a4d)

* With with '2', '1g' rings we can measure upto '2g'.
* We cannot pay '3g'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f475d77b-c839-4403-aa69-ee9b40a360da)

* To pay the '3g', we need a '3g' ring.
* We did '2' cuts because we needed '2' cuts at a minimum but we don't know the location/position of the '2' cuts.
* If we guranteed want a '3g' loop then the 1st cut will be at the 4th ring.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45383d1e-ac5a-4e36-9dfd-cf23009f73d0)

* If we do the cut at the 4th ring then we will get a '3g' ring and a '1g' ring. The other '1g' ring is there when we initially did the '2' cuts.
* 1st cut -> 4th position.
* With the '1g, 1g and 3g' rings, we can measure upto '5g'.
* We cannot measure '6g'.
* To pay the '6g', we need a '6g' ring.
* We want a '6g' ring, so we will do our '2nd cut' at 11th position.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4eaa6951-1ee8-439a-b803-5e7b33ef84f2)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e25f01ac-8769-433f-8c3a-08382ba12e70)

* So the initially assumed '2' cuts were the cuts at 4th and 11th positions. [**IMPORTANT**] [Logic] 
* With the '1g, 1g, 3g and 6g' rings, we can measure upto '11g'.
* We cannot do '12g'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e47df88-7fec-4da9-bfaa-03945406a300)

* We would need a '12g' ring.
* 2nd cut -> 11th position.
* 11 + 12 -> 23
* From 11 to 23, we would have the '12g' ring.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c112310-979c-4713-9c7c-01fced3c63a6)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12e7cd89-a6af-4489-b210-942805aabfc6)

* With the '2' cuts, we got these '5' sizes of rings, which are '1g, 1g, 3g, 6g, 12g'. We can measure upto '23g'.

* 2
* No. of cuts -> 3.
* We will get '3', '1g' rings from positions, which we don't know. This is **fixed**. [Logic] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* We can measure upto '3g' but we cannot measure '4g'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79d0b50a-448c-41ed-a5e6-a427de590383)

* We would need a '4g' ring. So the 1st cut was at the 5th position.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fc645a4-3a3c-4203-af32-d0e6d6de9002)

* We now have '3 * 1g, 4g', so we can measure upto '7g'.
* We cannot do '8g'. so we need a '8g' ring.
* 6 + 8 -> 14g [6 to 13 length]
* 2nd cut is at 14g.

* We now have '3 * 1g, 4g, 8g', so we can measure upto '15g'.
* We cannot do '16g'. so we need a '16g' ring.
* 15 + 16 -> 31g [15 to 30 length]
* 3rd cut is at 31g.

* 1

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6ec9c35-c4c2-4f14-a973-f1c71bc0692b)

* With '2' coins, we can easily tell which one is fake in '1' time only.
* With '3' coins, we can easily tell which one is fake in '1' time only.
* We have '213' gold coin.
* We would want to eliminate max. fake gold coins as possible.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3a94893-6f91-4594-a0ff-1e88ac36f755)

* If we do half-half(1/2) of the '213' coins, then we will get '106' coins on each side of the balance. We will be left with '106' coins to check for the fake coin.
* If we do one-third(1/3) of the '213' coins, then we will get '71' coins on each side of the balance. We will be left with '71' coins to check for the fake coin.
* 71 < 106.
* So we will check **less** coins in one-third(1/3) than we do in half-half(1/2). That's why we are doing third(1/3) of the coins.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f22a7959-4ed7-41e1-b1a4-f7d890caa474)

* 71/ 3 -> 23, 24, 24.
* We should be comparing 'B and C' only because they are of the 'same' weight.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ea6d5b7-4845-4449-bc70-22059aea765b)

* After the 2nd weighing, we are able to eliminate either 23 or 24.
* It won't make any difference if we take '23 or 24' coins.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a66610a9-3921-48d6-8c8a-0822c0ab65bf)

* 8 -> 3, 3, 2.
* From '8' we will get '2 or 3'.
* It is going to take '1' unit of time to measure us '2' coins or '3' coins. So it doesn't matter if we have '2 or 3' coins at the end. It is going to take '1' unit of time to measure them and find out which is **fake** coin.
* Whichever we pick whether it is '23 or 24', it is going to take us the **same amount** of time. [Logic]

* For '4' coins, it is going to take us min. of '2' weights.
* Always doing **one-third(1/3)** is the funda/logic here. [Logic] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* Let's do it with **one-third(1/3)** weighing.

* 2nd weighing -> 24 -> 8,8,8
* 3rd weighing -> 8 -> 3,3,2.
* We would take the equal weights which is '3'.
* We will see which is **fake**.
* For 4th weighing we can either get '2 or 3'.
* 4th weighing -> 2 or 3 -> Final fake coin found.

* We weighed, 'A and B' first and they were equal in weight. So we weighted 'A and C'. We have to identify if they are lighter or heavier.
* So after '2' weighings, we have identified if they are lighter or heavier.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ee35eaa-bc0c-4b83-a54d-b592940a40e2)

* 'B' contains lighter coin.
* In the cases, out of the '3', one of them would be either **heavier or lighter**  and the other two would be of **same/equal** size. [Logic]
* One is a fake coin.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98dbbfa2-4797-43c4-9e44-7563f512a6a4)

* None of them are **same/equal**, this is **not possible**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/897eb34d-5320-44af-b77a-e87e83b84d41)

* After weighting '1 and 2', we have identified the '50' coin and have also identified whether they are heavier or lighter. [Logic]
* 50 -> 17, 17, 16.
* As we have identified whether they are heavier or lighter. So, to avoid the confusion, we would assume them to be 'lighter'. [Logic]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb054040-716e-40ef-bcce-28cff542ba49)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ac1a181-de23-45d3-86e8-b696db2b9176)

* A < B -> 'A' has the fake lighter coin.
* B < A -> 'B' has the fake lighter coin.
* A = B -> 'C' has the fake lighter coin.
* We can take either '17 or 16'. Either is correct.
* 16 -> 5, 5, 6 -> A, B, C
* A < B -> 'A' has the fake lighter coin.
* B < A -> 'B' has the fake lighter coin.
* A = B -> 'C' has the fake lighter coin.
* 5 -> 2, 2, 1 -> A, B, C
* A < B -> 'A' has the fake lighter coin.
* B < A -> 'B' has the fake lighter coin.
* A = B -> 'C' has the fake lighter coin.
* 2 ->  1, 1
* After '6' weighings we are able to find the fake coin which is heavier or lighter.  [**IMPORTANT**]

### Crypt Arithmetic

* In the last 10yrs, we got these types of question, '4' times. Application is more.
* Letters and numbers.
* Letters are represented in single digit nos.

* Question framing:-

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c7aed92-7f91-4c2b-8c82-68d2f2234e32)

* Approach -> We are searching for repeatation of letters. [Logic] [**VERY IMPORTANT**] 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16fcb0ef-3380-47fd-831f-a6c188af1d13)

* '0' case is not possible.
* '0' multiplied with '0' is '0' only. So '0' s not possible.
* '1' multiplied with '1' is '1' only but the letters are different, so '1' is not possible.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/730e3824-2372-421a-991e-32f76c1f3f18)

* '5' and '6' nos cases are possible.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/481569e3-c0ef-4a0d-9f4e-67b89f21e4ff)

* (any odd no) * 5 -> ends with '5'.
* We are taking **last digit**.
* The nos/digit are from '0 to 9'.

* (any even no) * 6 -> ends with even nos.
* Attacking point:- [Logic] [**VERY IMPORTANT**] 

1) A * A -> A(last digit)

* 0 * 0 -> 0
* 1 * 1 -> 1
* 5 * 5 -> 5
* 6 * 6 -> 6

2) A * B -> B(last digit)

* 3 * 5 -> 5
* 9 * 5 -> 5
* 6 * 2 -> 2
* 6 * 8 -> 8

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d40c5851-8079-4965-bcb9-d66395270410)

3) Multiplication ends in '1':-

* The nos are different only then '1' is not possible.
* 3 * 7 -> 1
* 7 * 3 -> 1.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e5f9980-8c85-4e87-902f-e36533fb88cc)

4) Addition -> Concentrate on the **leftmost** side.

* The nos are from '0 to 9', so the max. carry for the sum of '2' nos is '1' only.
* 9 + 9 -> '1' is carry.
* Carry will be either '0 or 1'.

* 9 [Question] [Set]

1) 4 digit nos is **reversed**.
2) dcba is even number.

* a = 2,4,6,8. 'a' cannot be '0'.

3) No. is less than 2500.

* 4 * 2500 = 10000.
* It becomes a '5' digit number.
* Number is greater than '1000'.
* 1000 <= no < 2500.
* 1st digit cannot be '0' as it is a 4-digit number.
* As the no. is between 1000 and 2500, so 'a' can be either '1 or 2'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a93897d-0d40-47db-8d61-de098e5fc3df)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e8e21c9-9c7a-4107-9c88-6e0cf1f77131)

* 'a' can be even nos and 'a' can be '1 or 2'. Therefore, 
* a = 2.
* 4 * 2000 -> 8000 something or 9000 something.
* d = 8 or 9.
* 8 * 4 -> 2
* 9 * 4 -> 6
* 'd' is '8' only, because the last digit of the no. is 'a' which is '2' and we are getting '2' in the multiplication of **4 * d -> 2** when 'd = 8'. Therefore,
* d = 8.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f478c5d-e9ab-4622-b1eb-2a50e554cb74)

* 2250 * 4 -> 9000.
* If the no cannot be '9000', then the no. must be less than '2250' only.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d59083ae-b83b-49c8-af5f-589d358dbf18)

* 8 * 4 -> 32.
* '3' is carried to 'c'.
* multiple of '4' will be **even** only.
* 4 * c -> even.
* 4 * c + 3 -> odd. [even + odd -> odd]
* So 'b' is **odd**. 'b' has '3' possibilities, 'b' can be '0 or 1 or 2' because we know that the no. cannot be more than '2250', so the max. value of 'b' is '2' only.
* As 'b' is **odd** and 'b' can be '0 or 1 or 2'. Therefore,
* b = 1. [1 -> odd, 0,2 -> even]

* c = 2 or 7

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a62583d-afa6-4122-bdb1-57c4e40d7ee6)

* If 'c = 2' then,
* 4 * 2 + 3 -> 11
* 4 * 1 + 1 -> 5
* c = 5
* We are getting two different values of 'c' which are '2 and 5'. This is not possible, so 'c = 2' assumption is **wrong**. Therefore,
* c = 7.
* 4 * 7 + 3 = 31
* 4 * 1 + 3 -> 7.
* This time, we are getting same values of 'c' which is '7'. So this is **correct**, so 'c=7'.

2) If the multiplication of '2' different nos is '1' then the nos are either '3 and 7' or '7 and 1'.

* 3 * 7 or 7 * 3 -> ends in '1'. 
* 101 -> Prime no, not divisible by either '3 or 7'.
* '201' is a multiple of '3'.
* '301' is a multiple of '7'.
* In the question, it is mentioned that all the letters are **unique nos**. [Logic]
* So in '301', we can see that 'E and F' both are having '3' as their number, which is not distinct numbers. So '301' is **wrong**. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee529440-9c83-4592-96e4-d9be53916a7f)

* There is no point in thinking in terms of **multiplication of '3'** because we want a '2' digit no. for 'DE' and the nos are starting from '401'. [Logic]

* This is not possible.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63e1573d-d8db-4d89-87e1-e4860721b454)

* B * O = O
* B cannot be '0,1,5,6' because,
* 0 * 0 = 0 
* 1 * 1 = 1 
* 5 * 5 = 5
* 6 * 6 = 6
* It means that 'B and Y' have the **same no**, which is not possible as it is stated in the question that all of the **letters** are of **distinct numbers**.   

4) If 'A * A = A' then the nos which are possible are '0,1,5,6'. [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

* This is not possible because we have seen in the previous logic that 'B' cannot be '0,1,5,6'. This is **wrong**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9d18e46-7d51-4cea-88c1-0cb358fd74dd)

* We will observe whenever there is **some repeatation**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5abe900e-8ff9-4bdc-80ca-706fb7b4531e)

* From 'B * B = B', there is **no carry** to the **next part(O)** because the result of 'B * O = O' only and nothing extra added. So the no. which can be 'B' is '3' because 'B * B = 3 * 3 = 9' and **no carry** and with '4' we will get '4 * 4 = 2' and '1' as **carry**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/162c8f14-feba-4fd6-a9de-877d3a3d4e10)

* If 'M = 2' which means that it is '20000 and something' which is not possible as the addition of the max values will only give '10000 and something'. So,
* M = 1.
* The no. has to be '10000 and something'.

* If we add '2' nos then the max. carry will be '+1' only.
* 9 + 9 -> 18 -> '1' as carry.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f078226-5e21-413a-b049-151cdb1cc5da)

* If 'R = 8' then '8 + 1 -> 9' and **no carry', so 'M' has no nos which is **not possible. So 'R = 8' is wrong.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df586fb6-b17c-41e0-b10d-67b3ef6cfd0c)

* R = 9, then '9 + 1 -> 10', '1' is the carry and it sets 'M = 1' which is **correct**.
* R = 9.
* O = 0.

* We want max. value for 'MONEY'.
* If 'N = 8' then 'P + E = 8' and '+1' as carry. We have already usedd 'R = 9 and N = 8', so we can't use '9 and 8'. We have to use '7 and 6' which will us '7 + 6 -> 13' and carry of '+1' which we wanted.
* Carry of '+5' is also not possible from the summation of '3' numbers(AMA).
* So, 'N = 8' is not possible.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f7d7f84-166a-428e-ac53-6a38f7818a92)

* If 'N = 7' then 'P + E = 17' which is not possible as '8 + 6 = 14' and then we have to do '+3' which is not possible from the summation of '3' numbers(AMA).  
* So, 'N = 7' is not possible.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43f82df4-f72f-48b3-a47d-e58a77cfa0df)

* For, N = 6 then 'P = 8 and E = 7' and we are getting a carry of '+1'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80449ebb-60d0-4d93-9005-e71d7f410236)

* 'N = 6' is not possible as we are having issue in the '+1' carry.
* 'P=7 and E = 8' and we knew that 'E' is an **even** number.

* If 'M = 8, A = 4' then '8 - 4 = 4' there is no carry then 'P = 4' and '4 - 4 = 0'. So 'D = 0'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f80590b9-4d4a-4526-a47a-5ca471bc070b)

* If 'R - Q = 0'  is only possible when 'R and Q' are consequitive nos and 'R' is **greater than 'Q'**. 'R' had given carry of '+1' to the previous no(P) then both 'R and Q' are **equal** and we will get **zero(0)**.
* Substraction of '2' different terms is '0' when '1' no. has given carry(+1) to another number.

* QD - PT.
* 60 - 59.
* '60' has given a carry to the previous no(A) then both 'QD = 59 = PT' are **equa** and we got **00**.
* Difference is of '1' only.
* 58 - 57, this is not possible because 'Q and P' will have no. '5' as their nos, which is not possible. So this is **wrong**.
* It can be '90-89', '80-79', '70-69'.

* We are replacing 'D and T' and putting their numbers.
* D - S = M
* 0 - S = M
* It has taken carry(+1) from 'A'.
* A - 1 - P = p

* Q = 2.
* P = 1.
* R = Q + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3.

* A = 5.
* Q = 3.
* P = 2.
* R = Q + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4.

* A = 7.
* Q = 4.
* P = 3.
* R = Q + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5.
* R = 5.

* 'A' gave carry of '1' to 'D' and then 'A' took carry of '1' from 'D' which is '+10'. When we take **carry**, '1' is not getting **added**, '10' is getting added. So,

* If 100 bulbs were touched normally.
* '10' bulbs changed state. '90' bulbs remained in **same** state.
* In Question '3', after the '50th' person the operation is stopped.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da8af63f-db6f-4ffd-853e-129cd4e73a66)

* For the 1st 50 bulbs they worked normally only. So, the '7' perfect square bulbs before '50' were touched **odd** no. of times.
* 64 -> 2 ^ 6 -> 7 -> odd
* But we can't have the factor '64' as it is greater than '50'. So it is '6' factors now. As it is **even** so the state remained the **same**.
* 81 -> 3 ^ 4 -> 5 -> odd
* But we can't have the factor '81' as it is greater than '50'. So it is '4' factors now. As it is **even** so the state remained the **same**.
* 100 -> 2 ^ 2 * 5 ^ 2 -> 9 -> odd
* But we can't have the factor '100' as it is greater than '50'. So it is '8' factors now. As it is **even** so the state remained the **same**.
* All of the **non-perfect squares** have **even** no. of factors. [**IMPORTANT**]

* 16 [Question] [Set] [**VERY IMPORTANT**] [Practice]
* Frequency.

* Frequency(F) can be different. We don't know the frequency. We only know the dates when the doctors visited the zones. They know some of the dates only, they don't know the middle dates.
* F = 8.
* We don't know the actual frequency.
* How we will find the frequency?
* It is also mentioned in the question is that "none of the zones were visited on consecutive days" which means that the **frequency** is **not '1'**.
* It is also mentioned that "each zone was visited atleast once in 7days which means that frequenncy is **greater than equal to '7'**.
* F <= 7.

* Zone A:-
* 1st March to 2nd April -> 32 days.
* 2nd April to 16 April -> 14 days.
* Common factor for  '32 and 14' is '2'.
* So the **possible frequency** is '2'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cd993d2-63c6-4426-9a95-3abaf81e5d2e)

* Frequency of two zones is only **equal** as mentioned in the question. So 'A and D' zones have the same frequency of '2' then the frequency of zone 'E' cannot be '2'. Hence for **Q2** the frequency of zone 'E' is '4'.
* 5th of march is **not the starting date** for zone 'E'. It is the date which the doctors have remembered.
* The frequency is '4', so the date can be '1st of march' also.
* It is no where mentioned that '5th of march' is the **starting date**. It is one of the dates that they remembered. [Logic]
* Do not assume anything. [Logic] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

* '1' is neither prime nor it is composite. [Formula]
* Prime -> 2,3,5,7,11....
* Composite nos -> All of the nos which are not prime numbers.
* GP -> In a series, when the same no. is getting **multiplied**. In the example, 'r' is getting **multiplied** everytime.  [Formula]
* AP -> In a series, when a **constant/same difference** is getting **added up/addition** is happening everytime. In the example, everytime '+3' is getting added to the numbers. [Formula]

* 2-digit numbers.
* In **multiplication**, we will have **more constrain** . There will be **more restrictions**.
* There can be so many things in **AP**. There will be **many cases** in AP. I
* AP is not the good way to start.
* GP is the good way to start.
* GP means **multiplication**. **Multiplication** will give us **more constrain/restrictions**.
* In **GP** same no. is getting multiplied.

* '10' is the smallest '2' digit number.
* We have to limit the nos. between '10 and 99'.
* We have observed that 'r' cannot be **more than or equal to '2'**.
* We can pretty sure that 'r' cannot be **equal to '1'**.
* So, 'r' has to be **greater than '1' but less than '2'**.
* These are points that we have to **observe** while **seeing/reading** the above given **set**. [**IMPORTANT**]
* 'r < 1' doesn't make any sense.

* We will get the nos. exactly **same** whether we go from **left to right** or from **right to left**.

* r = fraction.
* As it is a **fraction**, so the denominator(D) will have a **crucial role**.
* How do we pick the **denominator(D)**? [Question]
* 1 < 4/3 < 2.
* Everytime 'r' is getting **multiplied**.
* 'a' is some **integer/numbers**.
* Every no. is a **integer/numbers**.
* For the no., (256a/81) to be an **integer**, 'a' has to be a **multiple of '81'**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4ced0c7-9d71-4bea-b6bc-e5a3eea84a5f)

* Example.
* The last no is a multiple of '256'.
* This is not possible because as stated in the question that they are '2' digit numbers and '256' is a '3' digit number.
* We have to keep the no. smaller.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac3100c5-6cbc-448d-9ec8-6a3c5a3d8764)

* Our range is from '10 to 99'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d0dba60-be39-4b52-93a2-9a0befedc1ae)

* The smallest fraction can be '3/2'.
* The min. denominator can be '2' only as it is the smallest fraction. It cannot be smaller than '2'.
* Everytime 'r = 3/2' is getting multiplied.
* a = 16K -> multiple of '16'.
* We cannot take multiple of '16' because with 'a = 16', we are getting '81' as the last number. So if we multiple of '16', then the last number will be **greater than '100'** which we don't want.
* That's why we will put 'a = 16'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f657a95-5f62-4b6b-9588-cab87c9e1ea2)

* We got those '5' nos in GP.
* '6' nos are in AP.
* 5 + 6 -> 11
* Actually there was '9' numbers.
* 11 - 9 = 2.
* We will have '2' numbers which are common to AP and GP.
* '7' of them will be composite.
* So '2' nos will be prime numbers.
* We have '0' prime numbers in those '5' GP numbers.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8ced5c4-7605-4feb-9567-675217afe296)

* Prime no -> odd number.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1961af6-05f3-4896-a43c-8a1fb59037bc)

* Common difference -> 8.
* That '6' nos AP series is not possible because want '2' prime numbers as well.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dc3cb62-3d2e-451c-a555-7a5f5e8d242e)

* Common difference -> 4.
* That '6' nos AP series is not possible because all of the nos. are **even**. So no prime numbers as well.
* We want a **Common difference(CD)** whose factors are **odd** numbers.
* We wanted '2' common nos but '16 and 24' didn't work out. So we are trying '16 and 36'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/154d7614-7806-4e74-b3ec-4f4811dc2a71)

* Nos. in the AP series of '20' are all **even nos**. We want prime nos which are **odd numbers**.
* Odd factor of '20' is '5'.
* We got the '2' prime nos which we wanted and also got the '6' nos in the AP series.
* '2' nos are common also.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91d5df9e-86d5-469a-9885-d61841c766b3)

* We only want '6' nos in AP, we wrote '7' nos before.
* So, '46' is not in the AP series.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/106f7ab2-6d50-4fb9-9052-dd1d6e4004b6)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76571a53-0548-4860-a968-82fbb059ca5d)

* All of the '9' nos we wanted.

* 30 -> 5, 15, 3 -> Factors of '3'.
* Out of the '9' nos, '7' nos are **composite** which means that the rest of the '2' nos are **prime numbers**. [**IMPORTANT**]

* Normally in **exam** situations how many **cases** should we **think off**. [Logic] [**IMPORTANT**]
* Normally take around **4 to 5** cases max. during the **exam** situations. [Logic] [**IMPORTANT**]
* Dont make the **cases** messy. Don't take only '1' case. [Logic] [**IMPORTANT**]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64c7421c-a411-4c10-84f1-ce6aebc4fd5d)

* It is mentioned in the question that '2 and 5' are adjacent to each other and '3' is along with '2 and 5'.
* There is a '3' digit gap between '5 and 9'. 
* '4' is between '7 and 9'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1ec088e-e59a-4e31-a075-af77fd129092)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db31098d-b9db-4812-ae93-42f36d775dcd)

* It is mentioned in the question that '7' digit is at the 6th position of the password.
* It means that both of the '1 and 2' cases above are **incorrect**.
* If the starting is with '8 or 1' and the ending is with '2', that is not possible.
* Ending with '2' is not possible so we are pretty such that ending with '1' is **correct**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16f01a21-cef8-4d42-b8c7-459c7fa03efb)

* We are placing '7' at the 6th position of the password. '4' is between '7 and 9' so we have placed '4 and 9' in the different cases in different/opposite ways. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26adc520-fa29-46df-81bf-e14e33b0020f)

* It is mentioned in the question that consequitive nos cannot be adjacent to each other. So in **blue color case** we can see that '1 and 2' are djacent to each other. So that case is **wrong**.
* We will place '3' in the 9th position in 'case 3'.
* We cannot take **blue color case**, we will only take **white color case**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63da0bb1-04cf-4468-84ce-3a0f7c2d25c8)

* It is mentioned in the question that '6 and 0' are adjacent to each other.
* We cannot keep '6' in the 3rd position in 'case 3' because in 4th positio we have '5', adjacent numbers. So we will keep '0' in the 3rd position in 'case 3'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2831efcb-cf18-46c6-82ea-38110d4c180f)

* Any groups we will take which has only '2' nos, the **avg** of those '2' nos in that groups will be an **integer** no only, as mentioned in the question.
* It will happen when both the '2' nos in the group are either **odd or even**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbf6e696-292c-4a3a-b168-59ae420d23e4)

* All the nos are **multiple of '6'(6k)**. If all of the nos are **multiple of '6'(6k)** then even if we divide the nos by '2,3,4,5 or 6', in any case, we will get **integer** nos only.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76372d25-3311-47d1-ac6a-70cee13cf8f3)

* 2,3,4,5,6 -> 60.
* All of the nos are **multiple of '60'(60k)** only.
* For the value of '60', in any of the cases we will get an **integer**.
* The internal values are **multiple of '2,3,4,5 and 6'**.
* We have to satisfy all of the **cases** all at **once**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d60b3b0-7cc6-45ea-8ccc-1214c69bb268)

* All of the **cases** in the above example will not give **integers** all at **once**.
* Any '2' nos we will take and divide it by '2' will give us an **integer**.
* Any '3' nos we will take and divide it by '3' will give us an **integer**.
* Any '4' nos we will take and divide it by '4' will give us an **integer**.
* Any '5' nos we will take and divide it by '5' will give us an **integer**.
* Any '6' nos we will take and divide it by '6' will give us an **integer**.
* LCM(2,3,4,5,6) -> 60. [Logic]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae35793b-3f48-4106-a021-067835d2cdeb)

* If '2' nos are **multiples of '60'** then the difference between the '2' nos is also a **multiple of '60'**.
* Then the difference between 'Q and R' is in the range of '160 to 195' which means the difference is '180' as it is a **multiple of '60'**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8580dfa4-2735-48ba-b3c6-156407610417)

* We don't know the order of the difference between 'Q and R', whether it is 'Q - R' or it is 'R - Q'. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a154d6b9-0c0e-40aa-9c94-2623416ad3d6)

* We know that 'Q > R' so it cannot be that 'R - Q = 180'. It is 'Q - R = 180'.
* S = P + T.
* S = 3x + T [P = 3x]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e8569a9-4333-42cc-ac50-d7f3d8884385)

* Q - R = 180.
* R = 5x - 180. [Q = 5x]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b36ede39-0a65-4471-b096-8bd88f1426e3)

* Final equation.
* '3x, 4x, 5x' are multiple of '60K'.
* '10x' is a multiple of '60K'. [10 -> 2,5]
* 'T' is a multiple of '60K'.
* '1440' is a multiple of '60K'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f95b449-14e2-4b4a-a67d-2d25d06d5c7d)

* 'x' is a multiple of '60K'.
* 10x = 10 * 60k = 600k.
* Thinking about **multiple of '600'**.
* 600k = 600 * 1 =600.
* 1440 - 600 = 840.
* We cannot have individually **more than '800'** at once.
* 840 > 800.
* So, this is **not possible**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09d3b6cc-e73d-46ce-a3b3-b20cbf7d2cf9)

* 600k = 600 * 2 1200.
* 1440 - 1200 = 240.
* 240 < 800.
* So, this is **possible**.
* 600 * 3 = 1800
* 1800 > 1440.
* So '1200' is the **only case** possible. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b13d9e33-5692-4909-bdf7-af4623f20672)

* T = 240.
* 10x = 1200
* x = 120.
* P = 3x = 360.
* Q = 5x = 600.
* R = 5x - 180 = 420.
* S = 3x + T = 360 + 240 = 600.
* T = T = 240.
* U = 4x = 480.

## Puzzles, Matrix formation (Part - 12)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ca5930c-3a55-426f-afa4-77e157aa7753)

* 21. [Question] [Set] [**VERY IMPORTANT**] [Practice]
* We need to build a kind of **matrix** here. [**IMPORTANT**]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eac488e9-dc86-42c6-9c54-d3507f7ccdae)

* In a **matrix** formation, don't fix anything **bliendly**. [Logic] [Fomula] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* We have a '6 * 4' matrix which means we are filling '6 * 4 = 24' elements in the **matrix**.
* Don't fix any of the **rows**. [Logic] [Fomula] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* After reading all of the lines in the **question** then decide what to do. For which **row**, the **question** has the **max.** info. [Logic] [Fomula] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* We have filled the wrong things and we are paying the penalty by wasting our time in solving it in a longer amount of time. [Logic] [Fomula] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* From the **start**, we don't have to take anything to our **heads**. Based on what was written on the **question**, we have to **attack** accordingly. [Logic] [Fomula] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

* We have '6' people who belong to these '4' countries.
* In any of the '2' countries there will be '2' people and in the other '2' countries there will be '1' people only.
* These is same for **language** as well.
* In any of the '2' languages there will be '2' people and in the other '2' languages there will be '1' people only.

* Every line needs to be read in-depth.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66fcc1dd-8204-4a3e-9154-68b355ba317c)

* From the 2nd statement we can see that, 'Q' definitely doesn't work in company 'J'.
* 'a, b and c' -> some country currently unknown.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b5f81f1-6a00-4122-8b78-bfd9b4f0dd29)

* There are '2 a' and 'a' is **south africa** because it cannot be **france**. 'Q' is already from **france** as mentioned in the **question**. So if 'a' is **france** then there will be '3' people from **france**. So 'a' cannot be **france** and it is **south africa**.
* a = **south africa(SA)**.
* Now we have to find the connecting points with or from **south africa(SA)** to solve it **easier/faster**.
* We found that **SA** people don't know **german**. So we cross out **german** as a **lang** for 'U'. 'R' already had a **lang**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1d30561-6f62-4481-9c32-bdc21fb4799d)

* As 'R' has **lang** as **polish** already and 'R' is from 'SA'. 'U' is also from 'SA' so 'U' cannot have **lang** as **polish** as it is mentioned in the question that **same country people cannot have the same language**.
* 'P' cannot have 'J' as company because 'J' company's people speak **german** but 'P' doesn't speak **german**.
* 'Q' cannot have 'J' as it is mentioned in the question that 'Q' is not from the company 'J'.
* 'U' cannot be from 'J' as 'U' cannot speak **german** and people from company 'J' can speak **german**.
* Already 'Q' has **lang** as **german** and country as **france**. 'S' has **lang** as **german** already, so 'S' **cannot** have country as **france** as mentioned in the question that **same people having the same language cannot have same country**. 
* Finally, 'S' takes 'J' and the **lang** of 'S' is **german**.

* As 'S' cannot have 'france' so the only other option is **russia**.
* So the **country** of **S** is **russia**.
* We are left with 'P' only.
* So the **country** of **P** is **france**.
* We have already filled **german** as a **lang** for '2' people. We cannot do more.
* We cannot fill **H -> English** in **Q and T**. We can in **P and U**.
* We cannot fill **M -> polish** in **Q,T and U**. We can in **P** only.
* So, **company** of 'P' is 'M' and the **lang** of 'P' is **polish**.
* We can put **H -> English** at **U** only.

* **Other pilot** who flew to 10000 feet used an **eagle** jet.
* 'L' didn't use an **eagle** jet.
* Lowest -> 10000 swirls.
* 70000/100 = 700.
* Winner(Rank 1) = 700 + 500 = 1200 swirls.
* 'M' is not 'Rank 1'.

* We are done with all of the points in the set.
* It is mentioned in the question that 'J and K' are not the **winner**.
* 'L' did the **lowest height** so it is also not the **winner**. Even if we give the highest no. of swirls which is '8' to 'L' then also the no. of swirls will be '800' only.
* No. of swirls for the **winner** is '1200'. So 'L' is not a **winner**.
* 'J, K, L, M' are not the **winner**. So 'N' is only left.
* 'N' is the **winner**.
* 'N' has '1200' swirls.

* 70000 * 3 = 210000. 
* '210000' is not divisible by '1200'.
* 'M' does not have jet as **woodpicker**.
* Only left are 'J, N and L' but 'N' is the **winner** so 'N' cannot be **woodpicker**.
* We can fix **Eagle -> 10000** in 'J' only. We cannot put it anywhere else.
* 'J' is **Eagle -> 10000**.
* Only left is 'L'. So,
* 'L' is the **woodpicker**.
* If **woodpicker** is 'x' height then the **winner** is '3x' height.
* x = 10000, winner = 3x = 30000.
* 'N' height is '30000'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cb70a12-a122-4b80-9c56-d19045d1ea84)

* 30000/100 = 300.
* 1200/300 = 4.
* '4' per 100 feet.
* 'N' is a category 'C' pilot.
* We know that the **winner** which is 'N' cannot have a **jet** of 'eagle or vulture'. So 'M' has a jet of **vulture** because 'J' has already taken **eagle**.
* 'N' has a jet of **penguin**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42a1829f-6062-4c7b-9450-a47295646855)

* 70000/100 = 700
* 700/700 = 1 swirl per 100 feet -> category 'A'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b355eb9-f403-40ec-b7cd-6451e357d926)

* With '50000' we will get '2' as '2' can divide '50000'.
* We are left with '2,6 and 8'.
* 50000/100 = 500
* 500 * 2 =1000 swirls.
* 500 * 6 = 3000 swirlss.
* 500 * 8 = 4000 swirlss.
* '3000 and 4000' swirls are not possible because the winner had '1200' swirls.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/feac3bce-3224-4377-809e-b87d541b671f)

* We are sure that with '50000' we can fit '2'. So it is of category 'B'.
* We are left with '6 and 8'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bd239a3-c46f-482c-bea2-bdd6bd0d314b)

* We know that **woodpicker** has the **lowest no. of swirls**.  'M' is the **woodpicker**, so it would have the lowest no. of swirls which is '600'.
* 'L' is '600'.

* Getting the **dates**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12d197f9-36f2-41c4-85b5-18111a89f2cf)

* 3/4 = 0 LY.
* 21-03-99 -> 99+24+21+3+0 -> 147 -> 147/7 -> 0 -> sunday.
* 13-11-07 -> 7+1+13+3+6 -> 30 -> 30/7 -> 2 -> Tuesday.
* DOW -> Date Of Week.
* From these we can immediately find the **age**.

* Dec of 1995 + 27yrs -> Dec of 22.
* We want till 1st of oct 22.
* So '22-12-1995' is '26yrs and a few months' old.
* Dec of 2007 + 15yrs -> Dec of 22.
* We want till 1st of oct 22.
* So '13-11-2007' is '14yrs and a few months' old.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4701aec-aba5-4a87-8460-fa934ce51291)

* Height of the '6' nos. is between '45 and 72' and they are **prime numbers**.
* Possible Heights -> 47, 53,59, 61,67,71.
* Weight of '6' people lie **between** '25kg to 70kg' -> It means that '25 and 70' are not included in the **weights** -> 26 <= weight <= 69.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/992a739c-46ea-43a3-a471-6d82ac927c59)

* Out of the '5' prime nos. greater than '67', we have to pick '4' of them.
* It is mentioned in the question that the **largest no** is **greater than twice the smallest number**.
* 43 * 2 = 86 < 89.
* 41 * 2 = 82 < 83.
* Combinations -> 71,73,79,83 | 71,73,79,89.
* Whichever combination of nos. we will choose, the **largest no** will be either '83 or 89'.
* We have to make the **avg = 67**.
* Sum = Avg * n. [n -> count/no. of numbers] [Formula] [**IMPORTANT**]
* The sum of '6' nos has to be '402'. Out of the '6' nos, '4' nos have to be **prime nos greater than '67'** and the rest '2' are **prime nos less than '67'**.
* We can do either of '2' things, take nos. and add them together to get '402' or we can do **Deviation**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24c3bf75-06dc-42d4-bc02-27abbd667bd9)

* Deviation. [concept] [**IMPORTANT**] [Formula]
* We have to maintain an avg of '67'.
* We want '2' nos whose avg. is '67' and one of the nos is '43'.
* The total deviation is always **zero(0)**.
* 67 - 43 = 24.
* 67 + 24 = 91.
* The avg. of '43 and 91' is '67' only.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb43d93a-42de-42b6-ac31-11b63f2e77e6)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b66991f3-14ab-4ced-beb6-007867814795)

* The other no. has to be '89' also.
* The total deviation in the lower part is **+44** and the total deviation in the upper part is **-44**.
* Total deviation = +44 + -44 = 0. [Example] [**IMPORTANT**] [Formula]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8811822-2fad-4cfb-8cf0-1d45ed42c910)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff44d8fa-5d4c-4814-b90e-ecc44920938d)

* The **total deviation** of the avg. is **0** only. [Formula]
* Positive and negative deviation.
* The min. age is '12'.
* The min. weight is '26'.
* The min. of **age + weight** is '12 + 26 -> 38'.
* All of the values(**age + weight**) will be greater than '38' only.
* The least prime no. is '41'. We cannot go less than '41'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee331e52-688e-4fce-abec-c3187ae9ed3f)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b597d4ac-0a55-4a62-a894-d56209726f30)

* As the lower part is '+44' then the upper part is '-44'.
* 67 - 43 = 24
* 44 - 24 = 20.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0ff9d39-9eaf-45ae-adcf-7f691f46d6c1)

* The remaining no. should be '67 - 20 = 47'.
* 67 - 18 = 49.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7acc580b-1e52-47e7-96be-94aed6318ad0)

* '49' is not a prime no, so **case 'II'** is **wrong**.
* We are pretty sure now that if we take '89' at the bottom then we should take '43' at the top. This is **working**.
* '41' is not possible as it is **not working** and we cannot go before '41' as '38' is the **minimum**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d51b9d20-b87d-4ce1-9f21-c016996e0e5b)

* 67 - 43 = 24.
* 48 - 24 = 24.
* We will get '2', **43** on the top, which is **not possible**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc260e92-17c5-439e-a98e-7f9ef8798a41)

* Instead of '43' if we take '41' then also we will get the other no. as '67 - 22 = 45' and '45' is **not a prime no.**, so **case 'III'** is **wrong**.
* '48 - 26 = 22'
* Instead of '71 and 73', we takee '73 and 79' then also we will not get a **prime number**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/464222ed-3d48-46c3-8e1d-681870180393)

* Only '1' case is possible.
* We will hold point '2' as we fully don't know the **names** yet.
* Age + weight + height -> It is a multiple of '10'.
* The '4' lower values are in AP.
* The '2' higher values are **equal**.
* Attack point '5'.
* If one of the points in the question is not helping then move to the next point. In **exam situations**, keep reading the **questions** and try to answer the **questions** as well to get the **marks**. Always look at the **questions** also. [Formula] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* '4 and 5' are attacking points.
* 'A' is '10yrs' younger than 'L'.
* 33 - 23 = 10yrs.
* We have '2' possibilities which are 'tues -> wed -> thus' or 'wed -> thus -> fri'.
* '14' is the 2nd youngest in the group.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/318fc3e8-0bd2-452b-badb-8c8d84e01b37)

* 'Tues' is gone.
* Now we have '1' possibility only 'wed -> thus -> fri' for '3' consecutive days.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ddb4694-522d-4d7b-98c7-6a063fadbf2d)

* We now got the **names** in order.
* Only '1' weight is a multiple of '5'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a947bf6b-ee2a-4de1-abd3-9aa61a5d3f39)

* We want '3' nos. which are in the difference of '10'.
* 79 + 71 = 8
* 8 < 10.
* If we take '43,47 and 71' then the difference is **more than '10'.
* If we take '73, 79, 89' then the difference is **more than '10'.
* So only '71,73 and 79' is possible.
* We have blocked these '3' nos for those '3' people as we don't know the **order/arrangements** of the numbers. We can **shuffle**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a196fb2-55e2-414d-9b99-bb456288ac6e)

* The weights of 'L and P' are consecutive. So we are taking them as 'x and x+1' respectively.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d06d3a1-704d-4da2-a248-8ca72d17db49)

* We have '3' nos, which are '71,73, 79'. Out of the '3' nos we are selecting '2' numbers.
* 71 - 33 = 38.
* 73 - 26 = 47.
* They are not **consecutive** numbers**, we want **consecutive** numbers**. 
* 79 - 33 = 46
* 73 - 26 = 47.
* They are **consecutive** numbers**.

* 71 - 19 = 52.
* '1,2,5,6' points are done.
* '3 and 4' are left.
* Age + weight + height -> It is a multiple of '10'.
* We have to make(x) maximum.
* With '79' we will add '71 or 61' so that the **sum** is a multiple of '10'.
* As '71 or 61' are ending with '1' so they will go with either '79 or 89'.

* 79 + 71 -> 150
* 79 + 61 -> 140.
* 89 + 71 -> 160
* 89 + 61 -> 150.
* To get **same/equal** values, we have to do:-
* 79 + 71 -> 150
* 89 + 61 -> 150.
* They need to be **same/equal**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43c3a62e-09f9-4425-ac3c-e3cdd90f68b1)

* For '59' to be a **multiple of '10'** it has to be added with '71'.
* 59 + 71 -> 130.
* 89 - 23 = 66.

* '90,100,130, 140' are not in AP.

* '4' values should be in AP.
* With '47', the no. '53' will go as we need **multiples of '10'**. The sum is '100'.
* With '73', the no. '47' will go as we need **multiples of '10'**. The sum is '120'.
* With '67', the no. '43' will go as we need **multiples of '10'**. The sum is '110'.

* The **order** doesn't matter.
* In the middle there is consecutive natural numbers.
* Sum of lotus is '81'.
* '15' slots means 15 consecutive natural numbers.
* Sum is '81', so **1 slot** is not possible. The max. is upto '35'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/caad4a82-eb9f-47bd-8dbf-a23547d722ef)

* Every row has how many slots.
* We cannot have consecutive numbers. If we have '3' nos in a row then the previous row cannnot have '2 or 4'.  If we have '3' nos in a row then the next row cannnot have '2 or 4'.
* '2 or 4' are consecutive nos for '3'.
* Lotus' sum is '81'.
* 15 slots means '15' consecutive natural numbers.
* If '21' is minimum then the max./last one is '35'. It cannot go beyond '35'.
* Sum of some consecutive natural numbers is '81'. We don't know the count.
* '1' slot is not possible because the max. no. is '35'.
* '2' slot sum is '81'.
* 40 + 41 = 81.
* This is not possible as max. is '35'.
* '2' slot is not possible because the max. no. is '35'.
* 81/2 = 40.5 = 40 + 41.
* 81/3 = 27 = 26 + 27 + 28.
* 81/4 = 20.25 = 19 + 20 + 21 + 22 = 82
* With '4' slots, '81' is not possible.

* We are sure that the no. of possibility is '1' only.
* We got '3' slots.
* So for the next, the no. of slots cannot be '2 or 4' as they are **consecutive** to '3'.

* Let's try with either '1 or 5' case. We have to take one of them and move forward with it. We can't wait. We have to do both of them and see which one is **working** on our own.
* We are starting with '5'.
* If we have taken '5' in 'J' then we are left with '1' in 'R'.
* If '1' in 'R' then we cannot have '2' in 'Lavender', we have '4' in 'Lavender'.
* Finally we will have '2' in 'M'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c747d816-bea2-4c89-8abe-68dc63388a4d)

* From the last no. in 'J' being '21' and the 1st no. in 'Lotus' being '26'. We have left some nos between '21 to 26'. Those nos we have written somewhere else.
* As 'Lavender' has '4' slots so the above missing nos will come to 'Lavender' only.

* 109 - (17 + 26 + 22) = 44/2 = 22.
* 119 - (21 + 28 + 25) = 45/2 = 22.5 = 22 + 23.
* 15 + 29 = 44.
* We cannot have '15' because after '15', we have '17'. We don't have '16'. This is not possible.
* So, instead of '15', we will put '16' here.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f8f7ece-957f-4212-b20b-a15f71f3e7cf)

* '16' is also not possible.

* 16 + 30 = 46.

* We don't know the **total no. of pirates**. We have to guess by the **no. of gold/silver coins**.
* The order is from **youngest to oldest** for **gold coin**.
* The order is from **oldest to youngest** for **silver coin**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abf493c0-22ee-4d25-a667-fa43099abfd0)

* S - G = 56.
* We have to find till which point the difference of gold and silver coin is **56**.
* 20 - 10 = 10.
* The difference is '10'.
* 84 - 28 = 56.
* Now the difference is '56'.

* When the difference is '56' then we can say that the **gold and the silver** coins are **finished**.
* So, we had a total of '8' pirates.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b36cc61-164e-4122-933e-4b01ae43131f)

* When the difference between the **gold and the silver** coins is '56' which means that all of the **gold and the silver** coins are **gone** now. They are **finished/gone**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf4f0cca-0709-453a-a99a-544ec81c84b0)

* No. of pirates -> 8.
* 8x + 24 = 148
* x = 15. 
* The **oldest pirate** got **'x + 7 = 15 + 7 = 22'** gold coins.
* The **oldest pirate** got **'x = 15'** silver coins.
* The **youngest pirate** got 'x = 15' gold coins. 
* The **youngest pirate** got 'x + 28 = 15 + 28 = 43' silver coins. 
* Oldest = Youngest.
* 22G + 15S = 15G + 43G
* 7G = 28S
* G = 4S.
* '1' gold coin is equal to '4' silver coins.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/981ee20d-7619-4d11-9b39-c81ef2afd48a)

* We don't know the ratio of gold and silver coins. We calculated that for question '3' only. We have to find for question '4'.
* '1' gold coin = 'y' silver coin.
* The young pirate got '15' gold coins.
* The young pirate got '43' silver coins.
* '1' gold coin = 15y + 43
* 'x + 1' -> 16.
* 'x + 21' -> 15 + 21 -> 36.
* '2' gold coin = 16y + 36.

* In the **question**, we have to find the **min. value of 'y'**.
* It is written that the **total worth** of the **youngest person** is the **least/minimum**.

* We can see a **pattern** that 'y' is **decreasing**.
* y> 7,6.5,6.
* The min. value of 'y' is '8'.
* 'y' is an integer greater than '7'.
* We want a no. in 'y' which is going to satisfy all of the cases.

* The difference between 'S1 and S2' that is the **same difference** between 'S2 and S3'.
* d -> The difference.
* This is called as **AP**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd2897bf-1d68-4048-aae8-420a0de09f28)

* Sum of the nos. from '2 to 10'.
* Sum in **AP** = n/2 * (a + l). [Formula] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* n -> count of nos
* a -> smallest no
* l -> largest no
* We have to distribute in '3' parts.
* S1,S2,S3 -> They are in **AP**.

* The advantage of everytime adding 'd' is that 'd' variable is getting **eliminated** and we are left with 'a' variable only.
* a - d + a + a + d = 3a.
* Sum = 3a.
* We have divided the nos. from '2 to 10' into '3' parts and their **sum** is '54'.
* The **sum** of the '3' parts should be '54' only.
* S1 + S2 + S3 = 54.

* Difference between S1 and S2 is '5'. '5' is a prime number.
* 8 + 9 + 10 -> 27.
* The next prime number after '23' is '29' but it is far away as the max. we can do is still '27'. So,
* 13 -> 18 -> 23. [Final]
* '13 and 23' are the '2' prime nos. which we wanted.

* Max. sum is '27' that's why we cannot do '29'.
* We need to make the **cases** now.
* We can fill them with nos. from '2 to 10'.
* While taking the nos. always take the max. nos which is **available** and go from there. [Formula] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* 10 + 7 + 6 -> 23.
* 9 + 5 + 4 -> 18.
* 2 + 3 + 8 -> 13.
* Finding the **cases** which the nos. add up to total number. [Formula] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* Before starting another **case** see if the previous combinations had more **options/combinations** which we can do.
* We have no more cases with **10,7 and 6**.
* With '10,5,8', we can have another case which is '9,7,2'. So we will do another case with '10,5,8'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1dabbc1-9607-444d-a3d8-35a90f1f34d4)

* We cannot do with '7' as we need '18 - 7 = 11' from the rest '2' digits which is not possible because '5' has been already before in '10,5,8' and if we do '7,6 and 4' then we get '17' but we want '18'. That's why it is not possible.

* We are done with the '10' cases. We will try cases with '9'.
* We cannot do '10' in '13' because then we will need '1 and 2' along with '10' and we don't have '1'.
* We cannot do any more cases with '9' because then we will need '9,7,7' which is **not possible**.

* "Prices has to be in integers" -> Add it in the above question.
* 29. [Question] [Set] [**VERY IMPORTANT**] [Practice]
* We can interpret from the question statement is that not all of the children are speaking the truth. People speaking **lies** is **atleast '1'**. We know that not all of them are speaking the **truth**.
* We will try to **minimize** the **lie**. Min. value of **lie** is '1'. Atleast one(1) person is lying. Max. people are speaking the **truth** which means min. people are lying.
* One of the children is atleast **lying** and that should be **exactly '1'**.
* In the **set**, '5' people are telling the **truth** and '1' person is **lying**.
* They have bought '5' items.
* The children are saying the price of '4' items.
* The no. of possible combinations possible are '5'.
* We have '5' items and the people are sayig the price of '4' items only.
* 5C4 -> 5.
* We are assuming the prices of the '5' items as 'P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d2459bc-6f24-46c7-833e-73d55f3eb54e)

* We don't have any problem with their ordering.
* Any '4' item's price is '70'.
* The **name and order** doesn't have any importance. We are taking '5' prices for the '5' items the people have bought.
* We have a total of '6' people.
* The combination of prices will be those '5' only. '6' is not possible.
* We can generate a **new equation** by adding all of the **equations**. [Concept] [Formula] [**IMPORTANT**]
* Whatever prices we will put, the total sum of the prices should be a **multiple of '4'(4K)**. This is a **big hint**. [**IMPORTANT**]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bec18ee8-bc41-47fa-a248-ad9fc29f4a29)

* If we keep all of the prices of the items then we get '365' as the **sum**. All of the nos. are close only. Somehow or the other the nos. will be closer to '365'.
* None of the sum of the '5' nos. can cross '365'.
* The max. sum will be '365' as we have taken all of the '5' largest numbers.
* The min. sum will be '360' as we have taken all of the '5' smallest numbers.
* Between '360 and 365', there are '2' possibilities which are **multiples of '4'**. It is either '360 or 364'. No other possibilities there.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3437d42b-de47-4861-ac2c-b5ce4bb42f2b)

* We have to **decrease '1'** from the nos. of '365' to get '364'. We reduced the no. '71' to '70'.
* We don't have any other possibilities.
* 90 * 4 = 360.

* We have to calculate the prices of the individual values also.
* We will compare **case '1'** with **case '1'** and **case '2'** with **case '2'**. [**IMPORTANT**]
* **CASE '1'**:-
* P1 to P4 = 70. (1)
* P1 to P5 = 90
* 70 + P5 = 90
* P5 = 20
* 71 + P4 = 90 (2)
* P4 = 19.
* 72 + P3 = 90 (3)
* P3 = 18.
* 73 + P2 = 90 (4)
* P2 = 17.
* 74 + P1 = 90 (5)
* P1 = 16.
* **CASE '2'**:-
* P1 to P4 = 70. (1)
* P1 to P5 = 91
* 70 + P5 = 91
* P5 = 21
* 72 + P4 = 91 (2)
* P4 = 19.
* 73 + P3 = 91 (3)
* P3 = 18.
* 74 + P2 = 91 (4)
* P2 = 17.
* 75  + P1 = 91 (5)
* P1 = 16.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0e1864d-2d07-4604-8e2f-013c651663ce)

* We need to take both of the **cases** parallely.
* In case '2', for 'P4 and P5' whose prices are '19 and 21' respectively **add** upto '40'.
* We have to answer question '1' in terms of **case '2'**.
* It means that **case '2'** is **correct**. **Case '2'** didn't have '71' as one of it's numbers. So whoever said '71' as the price had **lied**.
* As **aboli** said '71' so she **lied**.F 
* Answer -> Aboli. [1] [Solution] [Answer] [**VERY IMPORTANT**] [practice]
* '18' is there in both of the cases. Case '1' has price as '90' and case '2' has price as '91'. It is ambigious/ambiguity there, we don't know fully.

* 30. [Question] [Set] [**VERY IMPORTANT**] [Practice]
* 1 trillion = 1000 billion.
* GDP never shrunk -> It was never negative. It was '>= 0'.
* Till '2016', the GDP was **divisible by '100'**.
* Growth rate is a **multiple of '5'** and the max. is '25%'.
* Growth rate -> 0%,5%,10%,15%,20%,25%.
* '0%' is also there because we need '6' nos and '0' is a **multiple of '5'**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba54e81c-292f-40a2-87ad-489d6928f567)

* Absolute growth -> absolute change -> value change.
* Jatin's scam is the **earliest** -> '2013' is the **earliest** year.
* Jatin's scam -> 2013.
* Predicted growth rate -> 25%.
* No reduction in growth rate -> 25%.
* 2012 -> 2 trillion -> 2000 billion.
* 2013 -> 25% of 2000 -> 2500 billion.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3b3f0cb-29f7-4e7b-80c4-532670ce70d1)

* We know that till '2016', the GDP was divisible by '100'. So out of these '4' years, any '2' out of the '4' years were also divisible by '300' because if a no. is divisible by '100' then the no. is also divisible by '300'.
* GDP was the **same** in '13 and 14' which means that growth rate is '0%' in '14'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e74c100-c696-451c-a09d-f724448cfe1d)

* All of the points of the question are done but the matrix is barely filled.
* '2500' is not a multiple of '300'.
* In '2' of the '4' yrs which were multiple of '100' the GDP is not a a multiple of '300'. So, in the remaining '2' yrs, we have to find th **growth rate** so that the GDP of '15 and 16' are multiples of '300'.
* 2500 * 1.05 -> 2625 -> It is divisible by '3' but not by '300'.
* 2500 * 1.2 -> 3000 -> It is divisible by '3' as well as '300'.
* 2015 -> 3000 billion.
* 3000 * 1.05 -> 3150 -> It is divisible by '3' but not by '300'.
* 3000 * 1.15 -> 3450 -> It is divisible by '3' but not by '300'.
* 3000 * 1.1 -> 3300 -> It is divisible by '3' as well as by '300'.
* 2016 -> 3300 billion.

* We don't know the **order** of **bhim and bikrant** scams. So we will keep them in shuffle.
* They carried out their **scams** when the GDP was **divisible by '300'** which was in '15 and 16'.
* If the GDP is not a **multiple of '100'** then it is not a **multiple by '300'** as well.

* In '2' yrs, the **absolute growth** is the **same**.
* 2012 -> 2000
* 2013 -> 2500
* **Absolute growth** from '12 to 13' is '500'.
* 2014 -> 2500
* 2015 -> 3000
* **Absolute growth** from '13 to 14' is '500' also.
* The above point is **done**.
* Till now the **highest increase** of GDP is '500'.
* We have '2' options, to do growth rate of '5% or 15%' to '3300'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85444d00-fce5-4da0-bcf1-0bafa5331918)

* 3300 * 5% * 15% -> 3985.
* 3300 * 15% * 5% -> 3985.
* In case of **rahul** the GDP increase should be more than '500'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c086fb1-b377-41f1-afbe-8f13d2aa1d9f)

* We are getting a GDP increase of '520' when we are doing '3300 * 5% * 15%'. So, this is **correct**.
* First increase should be of '5%' and the second increase should be of '15%'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8202f02-271a-4a74-bfc9-217d06ee2b75)

* 3985 - 3465 = 520.
* We are getting a  GDP increase of '520'.

* We know one of the weight loss is '10%'.
* lightest weight is '150'.
* 5 * 10% -> 50
* 16 * 10% -> 160
* 14 * 10% -> 140
* 12 * 10% -> 120
* So, '50,140,120' weights are **not possible** because they are **less/lighter than '150'**. So only '160' is possible.
* The last weight which we were missing we got it, which is '160'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb5bdab4-aaa7-47fd-ad66-96329295b548)

* We have got most of the info. Now we will focus on **filling**.
* We need to find '2' weights whose difference is '1'.
* 150 - 5 -> 145.
* 160 - 16 = 144.
* We cannot change the combinations.
* As **divij** is heavier so his weight is '145'.

* 'A' is '160' and lost '16' pounds as others were already filled. So 'A' is the **accountant**.
* 'R' has crossed '180' so '180' will be at 'M' and 'R' will have '170'.

* Read the **question and the puzzle** together only. Don't solve the **puzzle** blindly. [Formula] [**VERY VERY IMPORTANT**] [Practice]
* First focus will be on **definite** points.
* Let's leave '1 and 2' points as they are starting with **if** so they are **indefinite** points. We will not waste time on **them**.
* 20 * 3 = 60.

* 54 -> 57 -> 60.
* AP -> +3.
* 57 -> 67 -> 77.
* AP -> +10.
* Patna -> 57 or 67.
* Let's leave '7 and 8' points as they are starting with **if** so they are **indefinite** points.
* Weight(W) - Age(A) >= 36.
* A + W > 100.
* '2' people have that 'A + W' greater than '100'.

* Reading the **indefinite** points with **if** words now.
* 1 -> True.
* 'Kinshuk' is '54kgs'.
* 'Windy' is '23yrs' old. So 'Navjot kaur' is not '23yrs' old which means that 'Abu Amin' is from 'bangalore'. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ff4f1d4-d752-4897-9bfb-ba85199ea786)

* Hold '7' as we don't know anything about it.
* We know that 'Abu Amin' is from 'bangalore' which means that 'Pankhuri' is from 'patna'.
* We know that the **weight** of the person from 'patna' is either '57 or 67'.
* 1st 4 rows have their weights already fixed, so 'Pankhuri' cannot be placed there.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5e19d1d-84f5-4686-9e42-7fe5d4d0af72)

* 'Pankhuri' is from patna.
* 'Abu Amin' age and weight is the **maximum**.
* 29 + 77 -> 106.
* 'Abu Amin' -> A + W -> 106. 
* 27 + 75 -> 102.
* These are the only '2' possibilities. Other possibilities are **less than '100'**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4a5b3ea-3f01-4960-a24e-daeccbbfec47)

* So, 'chopra' age is '27'.
* We know that bangalore weight is '77' so we can say that patna weight is '67'. We had '2' possibilities before.
* Chandigarh is '57kg'.

* 183 - 132 -> 51
* We are going to put '132' in the counting because those people came in '7AM' and left by '9AM' which is **less than '2hrs'**.  
* 117 - 51 = 66
* 160 - 66 -> 94
* The '51' people can stay **more than '2hrs'**, so they are not counted.
* The '66' people came between '8AM and 9AM' and left between '9AM and 10aM' which is **less than '2hrs'**. So they are **counted**.
* 157 - 94 -> 63.
* The '94' stayed for **more than '2hrs'**, so they are not counted. They came at '8AM' and exited after '10AM'.

* Prime no. are generally odd numbers. Even prime no. is **2** only. [Formula] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c9b82c7-49bf-4529-9334-a839bdc47833)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0506639-62cf-447c-80da-097a72becb37)

* If 'a,b,c,d' are all odd nos, then the no. will be an even number and vice-versa. All '4' nos cannot be **even or odd**.
* So, either '1' of the '4' nos is an even and rest are odd numbers or '1' of the '4' nos is an odd and the rest are even numbers.

* '1' is one of the '4' digits otherwise the multiplication of '2' distinct digits as a prime number is not possible. [Attacking point]
* If multiplication of '2' nos is a prime number then the '2' nos will be out of '7,5,2,3' numbers only.
* It is confirmed that it cannot be '3 even and 1 odd'. '1' is already confirmed to be the odd number.
* '7,5,2,3' numbers have many more odd numbers. We are getting many odd numbers.
* We are pretty sure that we have '1 even and 3 odd' numbers.
* Out of the '3' odd' numbers, we know that '1' is one of them.

* It can be either with '2' or without '2'. We have to check with **cases**.
* We don't want want to keep smaller nos., as the product of the '4' nos. is greater than '80'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cc7fc69-6fde-490e-ad61-8aac040c14b9)

* 4 + 1 + 7 + 3 -> 15 -> Sum is not a prime number that's why removing that.
* With '4' we cannot take '9'.
* We want '1' perfect square and '2' prime numbers.
* 4 -> 2 ^ 2 -> perfect square
* 1 * 7, 1 * 5 -> 7,5 -> prime numbers.

* 'a,b,c,e' points are meet. 'd and f' are left.
* Sum(S) -> 17 or 19 -> '2' cases only.

* If the sum is '17' then we cannot get the individual digits. So case '1 and 2' are **wrong**. According to point 'd'.
* Sum of digits is **not '17'**. 
* Sum of digits has to be '19'.

* If 'H' is '5' then 'HALT' value should be a **multiple of '5'** but '72' is not a **multiple of '5'**. So 'H' is not '5'.
* H = 1, R = 5.

* L can be '12 or 9 or 6'.
* If 'L' is '9' then 'LACE' value should be a **multiple of '9'** but '336' is not a **multiple of '9'**. So 'L' is not '9'.
* For 'L' we are left with '12 or 6'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3287ce1d-ac1d-4c66-8c39-b9650c870b83)

* 'C' is a new no. which hasn't come before yet.
* '3' has already come in 'L' as '3' is a **multiple of '12'** so '3' cannot go to 'A or E'.

* For 'A and E' we are left with '2 and 4'.
* We are getting '2 ^ 5' or '5' 2's but we should get '4'.
* 'L = 12' is not possible.
* We are left with 'L = 6'.
