* We get 4 puzzles in LRDI and we have to solve it in 40mins. If we are able to solve **2** out of the **4** puzzles then we will easily get **99+ percentile**. [Logic] [Summary] [Strategy] [Planning]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c915299a-7407-4c18-80cf-e53c503fb351)

* Every puzzle normally has **5** questions.
* 4 * 5 -> 20 questions
* 20 * 3 -> 60 marks
* We need to get around **30** marks(25 to 30) to get **99+ percentile**. [Strategy] [Planning]

* For **7**, we will pick **1 coin** and we are left with **6 coins**. Chanchal will pick which ever no of coins be it **1, 2, 3 or 4**, we can pick **4, 3, 2, 1** no. of coins respectively so that there is **1 coin** left which she has to pick and thus **loose** the game. [Logic] [Explaination] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* For **8** also it is **same** as **7** only. In **8** we will pick **2** coins so that the opponent lands on **6** which is the **loosing** number. [Logic] [Explaination] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* **7 and 8** are **winning** nos for me.
* We have to make th opponent pick the last **1** coin left at the end. [Logic] [Explaination] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

* We want **9** as it is a **winning** number because on **9** we can pick **3** coins and the opponent will be at '6' which is a **losing** number. [Logic]
* '10' is the same as '9'.
* 10 - 4 -> 6
* 11 - 4 -> 7 -> winning no.
* 11 is a losing no.
* **Trap** is on the **loosing nos**.

* How many coins 'A' should pick to ensure his win? [Question]

> The aim is to drop the opponent in the trap/losing numbers. [Logic] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

* Controlling factor(CF) -> min + max -> 1 + 4 -> 5.
* Series -> 5K + 1. 
* k = 39
* 5K + 1 -> 5 * 39 + 1 -> 196.
* Table has **200** coins. It is starting with **A**, so **A** will take **'4'** coins and **'B'** will have **196** coins left. As **196** is a **losing number** so the opponent will always lose. [Logic] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

* If last coin is left, then that coin has to be picked up.
* 2 <= n <= 5.
* They are playing **alternately**.
* Min. we have to pick **'2'** coins in normal situation.
* So we have **'2'** consecutive losing numbers.
* We don't want **'1 and 2'**. They are losing numbers.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47de43ba-9f9c-4649-bf38-78304cdae9fa)

* We would want to pick **'3'** because we can take '2' coins and the opponent is left with '1' coin only. So, we will **win**.
* 3 -> winning no.
* We want from **3 to 7** coins, these are winning numbers.
* 7 - 5 -> 2 -> opponent will lose.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a1b914c-443d-4791-93e2-3d105f5519bb)

* 2 [Question] [Set]
* We need to **minimize** the **no. of weights** we are putting on the balance. That's asked in the **question**. [Logic] [**IMPORTANT**]

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/MBA/assets/54589605/e0d46bb1-0962-42f8-bfd7-559bc5db13e7)

* 3kg - 1kg -> 2kg.
* 3 - 1 -> 2kg difference we have created.
* We can use the **difference** in the **weights**. [Logic] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* We have to put as **less weight** as possible.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/MBA/assets/54589605/ca0b6f15-0277-4614-a1d9-6a28f200f5d9)

* To measure '1kg' we will keep a '1kg' stone on one of the sides of the balance.
* To measure '2kg' we will keep '3kg' on one side and '1kg' on the other side of the balance. So the difference(3-1 -> 2) is '2kgs'.
* To measure '3kg' we will keep a '3kg' stone on one of the sides of the balance.
* To measure '4kg' we will keep a '3kg and 1kg' stone on one of the sides of the balance. So the sum(3 + 1 -> 4) will be '4kgs'.
* If we have **1kg and 3kg** stones then we can weight upto **4kgs**. [**IMPORTANT**]
* Now we can't measure '5kg' stone.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/MBA/assets/54589605/46e18d8e-ae8d-4331-94a7-8ff378f0b658)

* Instead of taking a '5kg' stone, we will take try to get the '5kg' by doing **difference** from both the sidess.
* 3 + 1 -> 4kg.
* 9 - 4 -> 5kg.
* If we have **9Kg** weight on one side and we put **1kg and 3kg** weights on the other side then the **differene** in the **weight** is **9 - (3+1) -> 9 - 4 -> 5kg**. This is how we will get **5kg**. We do not need a **5kg** weight.
* The difference is '9kg'.
* With the '9kg' stone we can measure '5kgs'.

* To use **min./minimize** the no. of **stones/weights** then we have to **maximize** the **value** of the stones. [Logic] [**IMPORTANT**]
* We have to put high value on the weights. We are maximizing the **weights**.
* With the weights of '1,3 and 9' we can measure upto a max. sum of **13kgs**.
* 9 + 3 + 1 -> 13kgs.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/MBA/assets/54589605/764d5c7b-af51-47c2-8771-e96d45f7d3ce)

* Put '9 and 3' on one side and '1' on the other side, so the difference will be '11kgs'.
* (9 + 3) - 1 -> 11kgs.
* Put '9' on one side and '3' on the other side, so the difference will be '6kgs'.
* 9 - 3 -> 6kgs.
* Put '9 and 1' on one side and '3' on the other side, so the difference will be '7kgs'.
* (9 + 1) - 3 -> 7kgs.
* * Put '9, 3 and 1' on one side and the sum will be '13kgs'.
* Max is '13kgs.
* We now we need to measure '14kgs'.

* 4 + 5 -> 9kgs.
* Instead of taking a '14kg' stone, we will take try to get the '14kg' by doing **difference** from both the sides. So we will take a '27kg' stone.
* 27 - 13 -> 14kgs.
* 13 + 14 -> 27kgs

* 5 [Question] [Set] [Doubt]
* We need to find some middle ground.
* For the 7days of work, the carpenter wants '140g' of gold as payment. Which means for every day's work, we have to give him '20g' of gold.
* 20 * 7 -> 140g.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d42da3ba-475e-474e-b489-4e8bf1cda856)

* On 1st day we had to cut '20g' from the gold biscuit and gave it to the carpenter for 1st day's work.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba09daf3-3645-4541-b8d5-6d7ca5d87cfb)

* On 2nd day, the carpenter would return 1st day's '20g' of gold and we would cut a '40g' piece from the gold biscuit and gave it to the carpenter for 2nd day's work.
* We are minimizing the no. of cuts.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d5bed2d-8544-49bb-9ce9-32fd48951631)

* On 3rd day, we would return the '20g' of gold the carpenter returned to us on day '2'. So at the end of day '3' the carpenter is having '40 + 20 -> 60g' of gold. 

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab579b6c-8ade-4a9e-b294-28a2e7ea9fb0)

* On 4th day, the carpenter would return the '20g + 40g' of gold and we would give the carpenter the '80g' piece of gold for 4th day's work.
* We didn't cut any pieces.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9b0a6c0-0e5e-4d6c-b84a-0cd20dfd86ae)

* On 5th day, the carpenter already had the '80g' of gold from the previous day and we would give the carpenter the '20g' piece of gold for 5th day's work.
* 80 + 20 -> 100g.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acb433ab-20ac-461b-b533-8e9a5f3dd397)

* On 6th day, the carpenter already had the '80 + 20g' of gold from the previous day, the carpenter would return the '20g' piece of gold and we would give the carpenter the '40g' piece of gold for 6th day's work.
* 80 + 40 -> 120g.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b65c7bd5-04bd-453b-a56f-1adbe227f827)

* On 7th day, the carpenter already had the '80 + 40g' of gold from the previous day, we would give the carpenter the '20g' piece of gold for 7th day's work.
* 80 + 40 + 20 -> 140g.

* Question.
* We got '10' weights of flowers. Why '10'?
* We have '5' different groups of flowers.
* We are weighing the flowers in groups of '3'.
* nCr -> 5C3 -> 10.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffadc83f-efac-4f13-aaa0-90a229cbfd4f)

* Each equation has '3' variables and we have '10' equations. So we will have '3 * 10 -> 30' variables.
* We have '5' different variables which means '30/5 -> 6'. So each variable is getting repeated '6' times.
* We want '5' equations.
* 6 * 5 -> 30.
* 1272.

* a + b + c + d + e = 212kg [Example]
* if, a + b + c = 106
* then, d + e = 212 - 106 = 106.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/517dd7ab-9fcd-46d7-880a-1370ddb61cdc)

* a + b + d = 116.
* a + b = 66
* d = 116 - 66 -> 50kg.
* d + e = 106
* e = 106 - 50 = 56kg.

* If the **middle** number is the **avg.** of the other '2' nos. then those nos. are in AP series. [Formula] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55e28601-5ba7-40ef-aaaa-819f03d5b534)

* d =50, e= 56, c= 40, a= 30, b= 36.
* We can see that **a,c and d** are in **AP** series.
* a,c, d -> 30 40 50.
* We know that tuberose is '40' because it is said in the **question** that tuberose is the avg. of tulips and hydrangeas. [Logic]
* tuberose -> 40
* We don't know if tulip is 30 or 50.
* We don't know if hydrangeas is 30 or 50.
* In the question, it is mentioned that hydrangeas is heavier than freesia but lighter than orchid. [Logic]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce91dd19-ff6e-46d6-9874-7f965cc8ea4f)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ee5f9bc-3ced-49b5-9fda-a0be0b902032)

* hydrangeas cannot be '30kgs' because it is mentioned that hydrangeas is heavier than freesia but '30kg' is not heavier than any other flower.
* So, the tupils is '30kgs' which is 'a'.
* It also means that tulips cannot be '50kgs' so hydrangeas is '50kgs' which is 'd'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dff18410-fc85-4798-8a6c-891d0b3c90be)

* As '56' is lighter than hydrangeas which is '50kgs' and it is mentioned that hydrangeas is lighter than orchid.
* So, orchid is '56kgs' which is 'e'.
* So the last freesia is '36kgs' which is 'b'.

* 7 [Question] [Set]
* With '1' cut we cannot give every number, so we will start thinking about **atleast '2' cuts**.
* Within the whole interlocking of 'n', we are doing '2' random cuts.
* If we are doing '2' cuts then we will get '2' rings of '1g' each. We will get '2' rings of '1g' each.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47b01254-5286-4f3b-8825-7bdb39f06a4d)

* With with '2', '1g' rings we can measure upto '2g'.
* We cannot pay '3g'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f475d77b-c839-4403-aa69-ee9b40a360da)

* To pay the '3g', we need a '3g' ring.
* We did '2' cuts because we needed '2' cuts at a minimum but we don't know the location/position of the '2' cuts.
* If we guranteed want a '3g' loop then the 1st cut will be at the 4th ring.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45383d1e-ac5a-4e36-9dfd-cf23009f73d0)

* If we do the cut at the 4th ring then we will get a '3g' ring and a '1g' ring. The other '1g' ring is there when we initially did the '2' cuts.
* 1st cut -> 4th position.
* With the '1g, 1g and 3g' rings, we can measure upto '5g'.
* We cannot measure '6g'.
* To pay the '6g', we need a '6g' ring.
* We want a '6g' ring, so we will do our '2nd cut' at 11th position.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4eaa6951-1ee8-439a-b803-5e7b33ef84f2)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e25f01ac-8769-433f-8c3a-08382ba12e70)

* So the initially assumed '2' cuts were the cuts at 4th and 11th positions. [**IMPORTANT**] [Logic] 
* With the '1g, 1g, 3g and 6g' rings, we can measure upto '11g'.
* We cannot do '12g'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dae018cf-479a-4ed7-9ad1-b4fdb377458b)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e47df88-7fec-4da9-bfaa-03945406a300)

* We would need a '12g' ring.
* 2nd cut -> 11th position.
* 11 + 12 -> 23
* From 11 to 23, we would have the '12g' ring.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c112310-979c-4713-9c7c-01fced3c63a6)

* 2
* No. of cuts -> 3.
* We will get '3', '1g' rings from positions, which we don't know. This is **fixed**. [Logic] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* We can measure upto '3g' but we cannot measure '4g'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79d0b50a-448c-41ed-a5e6-a427de590383)

* We would need a '4g' ring. So the 1st cut was at the 5th position.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fc645a4-3a3c-4203-af32-d0e6d6de9002)

* We now have '3 * 1g, 4g', so we can measure upto '7g'.
* We cannot do '8g'. so we need a '8g' ring.
* 6 + 8 -> 14g [6 to 13 length]
* 2nd cut is at 14g.

* We now have '3 * 1g, 4g, 8g', so we can measure upto '15g'.
* We cannot do '16g'. so we need a '16g' ring.
* 15 + 16 -> 31g [15 to 30 length]
* 3rd cut is at 31g.
