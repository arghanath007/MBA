* For **7**, we will pick **1 coin** and we are left with **6 coins**. Chanchal will pick which ever no of coins be it **1, 2, 3 or 4**, we can pick **4, 3, 2, 1** no. of coins respectively so that there is **1 coin** left which she has to pick and thus **loose** the game. [Logic] [Explaination] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* For **8** also it is **same** as **7** only. [Logic] [Explaination] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* **7 and 8** are **winning** nos for me.

* **1** was the **lossing no** after that it was **6** after that it was **11**. They are Lossing nos.
* After a **difference of '5'** we are getting **lossing nos**.
* 11 -> 16 -> 21.

### Last Pick Win (2)

* 1<= n <=4
* Alternately.
* **1, 2, 3 and 4** are **winning** numbers.
* **5** is a **losing** number.
* **6, 7, 8 and 9** are **winning** numbers because we can take **1, 2, 3 and 4** coins respectively to end up with **'5'** coins which is a **losing** number.

* Last Pick Win format.
* Alternatively.
* 2<= n <=4.
* If last coin is left on table, whoever chance it is, it needs to be picked. [Question]
* **1, 2, 3 and 4** are **winning** numbers.
* **5 and 6** are **losing** numbers because the min. coins we can take is **2**, so **5-2 -> 3** and **6-2 -> 4**, so the opponent can easily take those **'3' coins** and **'4'** coins respectively and win.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/MBA/assets/54589605/3d58f419-5106-4860-a382-028b7db24133)

* In **'1' chance** we can take a **max** of **'4' coins**. [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* We have to make sure that the **opponent** gets or falls on the **losing numbers(traps)** which are **5, 6, 11, 12, 13 and 14** as this is the **last pick wins** format. [Logic] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

* The min. we can pick is **4** only, we cannot pick **1, 2 or 3**.
* The game is at **15** only and if we pick **4** then it will be at **11** now. **11** is a **losing number**.
