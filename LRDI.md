* We get 4 puzzles in LRDI and we have to solve it in 40mins. If we are able to solve **2** out of the **4** puzzles then we will easily get **99+ percentile**. [Logic] [Summary] [Strategy] [Planning]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c915299a-7407-4c18-80cf-e53c503fb351)

* Every puzzle normally has **5** questions.
* 4 * 5 -> 20 questions
* 20 * 3 -> 60 marks
* We need to get around **30** marks(25 to 30) to get **99+ percentile**. [Strategy] [Planning]

* For **7**, we will pick **1 coin** and we are left with **6 coins**. Chanchal will pick which ever no of coins be it **1, 2, 3 or 4**, we can pick **4, 3, 2, 1** no. of coins respectively so that there is **1 coin** left which she has to pick and thus **loose** the game. [Logic] [Explaination] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* For **8** also it is **same** as **7** only. In **8** we will pick **2** coins so that the opponent lands on **6** which is the **loosing** number. [Logic] [Explaination] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* **7 and 8** are **winning** nos for me.
* We have to make th opponent pick the last **1** coin left at the end. [Logic] [Explaination] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

* We want **9** as it is a **winning** number because on **9** we can pick **3** coins and the opponent will be at '6' which is a **losing** number. [Logic]
* '10' is the same as '9'.
* 10 - 4 -> 6
* 11 - 4 -> 7 -> winning no.
* 11 is a losing no.
* **Trap** is on the **loosing nos**.

* How many coins 'A' should pick to ensure his win? [Question]

> The aim is to drop the opponent in the trap/losing numbers. [Logic] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

* Controlling factor(CF) -> min + max -> 1 + 4 -> 5.
* Series -> 5K + 1. 
* k = 39
* 5K + 1 -> 5 * 39 + 1 -> 196.
* Table has **200** coins. It is starting with **A**, so **A** will take **'4'** coins and **'B'** will have **196** coins left. As **196** is a **losing number** so the opponent will always lose. [Logic] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

* If last coin is left, then that coin has to be picked up.
* 2 <= n <= 5.
* They are playing **alternately**.
* Min. we have to pick **'2'** coins in normal situation.
* So we have **'2'** consecutive losing numbers.
* We don't want **'1 and 2'**. They are losing numbers.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47de43ba-9f9c-4649-bf38-78304cdae9fa)

* We would want to pick **'3'** because we can take '2' coins and the opponent is left with '1' coin only. So, we will **win**.
* 3 -> winning no.
* We want from **3 to 7** coins, these are winning numbers.
* 7 - 5 -> 2 -> opponent will lose.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a1b914c-443d-4791-93e2-3d105f5519bb)

* 2 [Question] [Set]
* We need to **minimize** the **no. of weights** we are putting on the balance. That's asked in the **question**. [Logic] [**IMPORTANT**]

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/MBA/assets/54589605/e0d46bb1-0962-42f8-bfd7-559bc5db13e7)

* 3kg - 1kg -> 2kg.
* 3 - 1 -> 2kg difference we have created.
* We can use the **difference** in the **weights**. [Logic] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* We have to put as **less weight** as possible.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/MBA/assets/54589605/ca0b6f15-0277-4614-a1d9-6a28f200f5d9)

* To measure '1kg' we will keep a '1kg' stone on one of the sides of the balance.
* To measure '2kg' we will keep '3kg' on one side and '1kg' on the other side of the balance. So the difference(3-1 -> 2) is '2kgs'.
* To measure '3kg' we will keep a '3kg' stone on one of the sides of the balance.
* To measure '4kg' we will keep a '3kg and 1kg' stone on one of the sides of the balance. So the sum(3 + 1 -> 4) will be '4kgs'.
* If we have **1kg and 3kg** stones then we can weight upto **4kgs**. [**IMPORTANT**]
* Now we can't measure '5kg' stone.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/MBA/assets/54589605/46e18d8e-ae8d-4331-94a7-8ff378f0b658)

* Instead of taking a '5kg' stone, we will take try to get the '5kg' by doing **difference** from both the sidess.
* 3 + 1 -> 4kg.
* 9 - 4 -> 5kg.
* If we have **9Kg** weight on one side and we put **1kg and 3kg** weights on the other side then the **differene** in the **weight** is **9 - (3+1) -> 9 - 4 -> 5kg**. This is how we will get **5kg**. We do not need a **5kg** weight.
* The difference is '9kg'.
* With the '9kg' stone we can measure '5kgs'.

* To use **min./minimize** the no. of **stones/weights** then we have to **maximize** the **value** of the stones. [Logic] [**IMPORTANT**]
* We have to put high value on the weights. We are maximizing the **weights**.
* With the weights of '1,3 and 9' we can measure upto a max. sum of **13kgs**.
* 9 + 3 + 1 -> 13kgs.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/MBA/assets/54589605/764d5c7b-af51-47c2-8771-e96d45f7d3ce)

* Put '9 and 3' on one side and '1' on the other side, so the difference will be '11kgs'.
* (9 + 3) - 1 -> 11kgs.
* Put '9' on one side and '3' on the other side, so the difference will be '6kgs'.
* 9 - 3 -> 6kgs.
* Put '9 and 1' on one side and '3' on the other side, so the difference will be '7kgs'.
* (9 + 1) - 3 -> 7kgs.
* * Put '9, 3 and 1' on one side and the sum will be '13kgs'.
* Max is '13kgs.
* We now we need to measure '14kgs'.

* 4 + 5 -> 9kgs.
* Instead of taking a '14kg' stone, we will take try to get the '14kg' by doing **difference** from both the sides. So we will take a '27kg' stone.
* 27 - 13 -> 14kgs.
* 13 + 14 -> 27kgs

* 5 [Question] [Set] [Doubt]
* We need to find some middle ground.
* For the 7days of work, the carpenter wants '140g' of gold as payment. Which means for every day's work, we have to give him '20g' of gold.
* 20 * 7 -> 140g.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d42da3ba-475e-474e-b489-4e8bf1cda856)

* On 1st day we had to cut '20g' from the gold biscuit and gave it to the carpenter for 1st day's work.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba09daf3-3645-4541-b8d5-6d7ca5d87cfb)

* On 2nd day, the carpenter would return 1st day's '20g' of gold and we would cut a '40g' piece from the gold biscuit and gave it to the carpenter for 2nd day's work.
* We are minimizing the no. of cuts.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d5bed2d-8544-49bb-9ce9-32fd48951631)

* On 3rd day, we would return the '20g' of gold the carpenter returned to us on day '2'. So at the end of day '3' the carpenter is having '40 + 20 -> 60g' of gold. 

 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab579b6c-8ade-4a9e-b294-28a2e7ea9fb0)

* On 4th day, the carpenter would return the '20g + 40g' of gold and we would give the carpenter the '80g' piece of gold for 4th day's work.
* We didn't cut any pieces.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9b0a6c0-0e5e-4d6c-b84a-0cd20dfd86ae)

* On 5th day, the carpenter already had the '80g' of gold from the previous day and we would give the carpenter the '20g' piece of gold for 5th day's work.
* 80 + 20 -> 100g.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acb433ab-20ac-461b-b533-8e9a5f3dd397)

* On 6th day, the carpenter already had the '80 + 20g' of gold from the previous day, the carpenter would return the '20g' piece of gold and we would give the carpenter the '40g' piece of gold for 6th day's work.
* 80 + 40 -> 120g.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b65c7bd5-04bd-453b-a56f-1adbe227f827)

* On 7th day, the carpenter already had the '80 + 40g' of gold from the previous day, we would give the carpenter the '20g' piece of gold for 7th day's work.
* 80 + 40 + 20 -> 140g.

* Question.
* We got '10' weights of flowers. Why '10'?
* We have '5' different groups of flowers.
* We are weighing the flowers in groups of '3'.
* nCr -> 5C3 -> 10.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffadc83f-efac-4f13-aaa0-90a229cbfd4f)

* Each equation has '3' variables and we have '10' equations. So we will have '3 * 10 -> 30' variables.
* We have '5' different variables which means '30/5 -> 6'. So each variable is getting repeated '6' times.
* We want '5' equations.
* 6 * 5 -> 30.
* 1272.

* a + b + c + d + e = 212kg [Example]
* if, a + b + c = 106
* then, d + e = 212 - 106 = 106.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/517dd7ab-9fcd-46d7-880a-1370ddb61cdc)

* a + b + d = 116.
* a + b = 66
* d = 116 - 66 -> 50kg.
* d + e = 106
* e = 106 - 50 = 56kg.

* If the **middle** number is the **avg.** of the other '2' nos. then those nos. are in AP series. [Formula] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55e28601-5ba7-40ef-aaaa-819f03d5b534)

* d =50, e= 56, c= 40, a= 30, b= 36.
* We can see that **a,c and d** are in **AP** series.
* a,c, d -> 30 40 50.
* We know that tuberose is '40' because it is said in the **question** that tuberose is the avg. of tulips and hydrangeas. [Logic]
* tuberose -> 40
* We don't know if tulip is 30 or 50.
* We don't know if hydrangeas is 30 or 50.
* In the question, it is mentioned that hydrangeas is heavier than freesia but lighter than orchid. [Logic]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce91dd19-ff6e-46d6-9874-7f965cc8ea4f)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ee5f9bc-3ced-49b5-9fda-a0be0b902032)

* hydrangeas cannot be '30kgs' because it is mentioned that hydrangeas is heavier than freesia but '30kg' is not heavier than any other flower.
* So, the tupils is '30kgs' which is 'a'.
* It also means that tulips cannot be '50kgs' so hydrangeas is '50kgs' which is 'd'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dff18410-fc85-4798-8a6c-891d0b3c90be)

* As '56' is lighter than hydrangeas which is '50kgs' and it is mentioned that hydrangeas is lighter than orchid.
* So, orchid is '56kgs' which is 'e'.
* So the last freesia is '36kgs' which is 'b'.

* 7 [Question] [Set]
* With '1' cut we cannot give every number, so we will start thinking about **atleast '2' cuts**.
* Within the whole interlocking of 'n', we are doing '2' random cuts.
* If we are doing '2' cuts then we will get '2' rings of '1g' each. We will get '2' rings of '1g' each.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47b01254-5286-4f3b-8825-7bdb39f06a4d)

* With with '2', '1g' rings we can measure upto '2g'.
* We cannot pay '3g'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f475d77b-c839-4403-aa69-ee9b40a360da)

* To pay the '3g', we need a '3g' ring.
* We did '2' cuts because we needed '2' cuts at a minimum but we don't know the location/position of the '2' cuts.
* If we guranteed want a '3g' loop then the 1st cut will be at the 4th ring.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45383d1e-ac5a-4e36-9dfd-cf23009f73d0)

* If we do the cut at the 4th ring then we will get a '3g' ring and a '1g' ring. The other '1g' ring is there when we initially did the '2' cuts.
* 1st cut -> 4th position.
* With the '1g, 1g and 3g' rings, we can measure upto '5g'.
* We cannot measure '6g'.
* To pay the '6g', we need a '6g' ring.
* We want a '6g' ring, so we will do our '2nd cut' at 11th position.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4eaa6951-1ee8-439a-b803-5e7b33ef84f2)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e25f01ac-8769-433f-8c3a-08382ba12e70)

* So the initially assumed '2' cuts were the cuts at 4th and 11th positions. [**IMPORTANT**] [Logic] 
* With the '1g, 1g, 3g and 6g' rings, we can measure upto '11g'.
* We cannot do '12g'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e47df88-7fec-4da9-bfaa-03945406a300)

* We would need a '12g' ring.
* 2nd cut -> 11th position.
* 11 + 12 -> 23
* From 11 to 23, we would have the '12g' ring.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c112310-979c-4713-9c7c-01fced3c63a6)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12e7cd89-a6af-4489-b210-942805aabfc6)

* With the '2' cuts, we got these '5' sizes of rings, which are '1g, 1g, 3g, 6g, 12g'. We can measure upto '23g'.

* 2
* No. of cuts -> 3.
* We will get '3', '1g' rings from positions, which we don't know. This is **fixed**. [Logic] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* We can measure upto '3g' but we cannot measure '4g'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79d0b50a-448c-41ed-a5e6-a427de590383)

* We would need a '4g' ring. So the 1st cut was at the 5th position.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fc645a4-3a3c-4203-af32-d0e6d6de9002)

* We now have '3 * 1g, 4g', so we can measure upto '7g'.
* We cannot do '8g'. so we need a '8g' ring.
* 6 + 8 -> 14g [6 to 13 length]
* 2nd cut is at 14g.

* We now have '3 * 1g, 4g, 8g', so we can measure upto '15g'.
* We cannot do '16g'. so we need a '16g' ring.
* 15 + 16 -> 31g [15 to 30 length]
* 3rd cut is at 31g.

* 1

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6ec9c35-c4c2-4f14-a973-f1c71bc0692b)

* With '2' coins, we can easily tell which one is fake in '1' time only.
* With '3' coins, we can easily tell which one is fake in '1' time only.
* We have '213' gold coin.
* We would want to eliminate max. fake gold coins as possible.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3a94893-6f91-4594-a0ff-1e88ac36f755)

* If we do half-half(1/2) of the '213' coins, then we will get '106' coins on each side of the balance. We will be left with '106' coins to check for the fake coin.
* If we do one-third(1/3) of the '213' coins, then we will get '71' coins on each side of the balance. We will be left with '71' coins to check for the fake coin.
* 71 < 106.
* So we will check **less** coins in one-third(1/3) than we do in half-half(1/2). That's why we are doing third(1/3) of the coins.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f22a7959-4ed7-41e1-b1a4-f7d890caa474)

* 71/ 3 -> 23, 24, 24.
* We should be comparing 'B and C' only because they are of the 'same' weight.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ea6d5b7-4845-4449-bc70-22059aea765b)

* After the 2nd weighing, we are able to eliminate either 23 or 24.
* It won't make any difference if we take '23 or 24' coins.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a66610a9-3921-48d6-8c8a-0822c0ab65bf)

* 8 -> 3, 3, 2.
* From '8' we will get '2 or 3'.
* It is going to take '1' unit of time to measure us '2' coins or '3' coins. So it doesn't matter if we have '2 or 3' coins at the end. It is going to take '1' unit of time to measure them and find out which is **fake** coin.
* Whichever we pick whether it is '23 or 24', it is going to take us the **same amount** of time. [Logic]

* For '4' coins, it is going to take us min. of '2' weights.
* Always doing **one-third(1/3)** is the funda/logic here. [Logic] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* Let's do it with **one-third(1/3)** weighing.

* 2nd weighing -> 24 -> 8,8,8
* 3rd weighing -> 8 -> 3,3,2.
* We would take the equal weights which is '3'.
* We will see which is **fake**.
* For 4th weighing we can either get '2 or 3'.
* 4th weighing -> 2 or 3 -> Final fake coin found.

* We weighed, 'A and B' first and they were equal in weight. So we weighted 'A and C'. We have to identify if they are lighter or heavier.
* So after '2' weighings, we have identified if they are lighter or heavier.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ee35eaa-bc0c-4b83-a54d-b592940a40e2)

* 'B' contains lighter coin.
* In the cases, out of the '3', one of them would be either **heavier or lighter**  and the other two would be of **same/equal** size. [Logic]
* One is a fake coin.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98dbbfa2-4797-43c4-9e44-7563f512a6a4)

* None of them are **same/equal**, this is **not possible**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/897eb34d-5320-44af-b77a-e87e83b84d41)

* After weighting '1 and 2', we have identified the '50' coin and have also identified whether they are heavier or lighter. [Logic]
* 50 -> 17, 17, 16.
* As we have identified whether they are heavier or lighter. So, to avoid the confusion, we would assume them to be 'lighter'. [Logic]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb054040-716e-40ef-bcce-28cff542ba49)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ac1a181-de23-45d3-86e8-b696db2b9176)

* A < B -> 'A' has the fake lighter coin.
* B < A -> 'B' has the fake lighter coin.
* A = B -> 'C' has the fake lighter coin.
* We can take either '17 or 16'. Either is correct.
* 16 -> 5, 5, 6 -> A, B, C
* A < B -> 'A' has the fake lighter coin.
* B < A -> 'B' has the fake lighter coin.
* A = B -> 'C' has the fake lighter coin.
* 5 -> 2, 2, 1 -> A, B, C
* A < B -> 'A' has the fake lighter coin.
* B < A -> 'B' has the fake lighter coin.
* A = B -> 'C' has the fake lighter coin.
* 2 ->  1, 1
* After '6' weighings we are able to find the fake coin which is heavier or lighter.  [**IMPORTANT**]

### Crypt Arithmetic

* In the last 10yrs, we got these types of question, '4' times. Application is more.
* Letters and numbers.
* Letters are represented in single digit nos.

* Question framing:-

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c7aed92-7f91-4c2b-8c82-68d2f2234e32)

* Approach -> We are searching for repeatation of letters. [Logic] [**VERY IMPORTANT**] 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16fcb0ef-3380-47fd-831f-a6c188af1d13)

* '0' case is not possible.
* '0' multiplied with '0' is '0' only. So '0' s not possible.
* '1' multiplied with '1' is '1' only but the letters are different, so '1' is not possible.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/730e3824-2372-421a-991e-32f76c1f3f18)

* '5' and '6' nos cases are possible.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/481569e3-c0ef-4a0d-9f4e-67b89f21e4ff)

* (any odd no) * 5 -> ends with '5'.
* We are taking **last digit**.
* The nos/digit are from '0 to 9'.

* (any even no) * 6 -> ends with even nos.
* Attacking point:- [Logic] [**VERY IMPORTANT**] 

1) A * A -> A(last digit)

* 0 * 0 -> 0
* 1 * 1 -> 1
* 5 * 5 -> 5
* 6 * 6 -> 6

2) A * B -> B(last digit)

* 3 * 5 -> 5
* 9 * 5 -> 5
* 6 * 2 -> 2
* 6 * 8 -> 8

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d40c5851-8079-4965-bcb9-d66395270410)

3) Multiplication ends in '1':-

* The nos are different only then '1' is not possible.
* 3 * 7 -> 1
* 7 * 3 -> 1.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e5f9980-8c85-4e87-902f-e36533fb88cc)

4) Addition -> Concentrate on the **leftmost** side.

* The nos are from '0 to 9', so the max. carry for the sum of '2' nos is '1' only.
* 9 + 9 -> '1' is carry.
* Carry will be either '0 or 1'.

* 9 [Question] [Set]

1) 4 digit nos is **reversed**.
2) dcba is even number.

* a = 2,4,6,8. 'a' cannot be '0'.

3) No. is less than 2500.

* 4 * 2500 = 10000.
* It becomes a '5' digit number.
* Number is greater than '1000'.
* 1000 <= no < 2500.
* 1st digit cannot be '0' as it is a 4-digit number.
* As the no. is between 1000 and 2500, so 'a' can be either '1 or 2'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a93897d-0d40-47db-8d61-de098e5fc3df)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e8e21c9-9c7a-4107-9c88-6e0cf1f77131)

* 'a' can be even nos and 'a' can be '1 or 2'. Therefore, 
* a = 2.
* 4 * 2000 -> 8000 something or 9000 something.
* d = 8 or 9.
* 8 * 4 -> 2
* 9 * 4 -> 6
* 'd' is '8' only, because the last digit of the no. is 'a' which is '2' and we are getting '2' in the multiplication of **4 * d -> 2** when 'd = 8'. Therefore,
* d = 8.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f478c5d-e9ab-4622-b1eb-2a50e554cb74)

* 2250 * 4 -> 9000.
* If the no cannot be '9000', then the no. must be less than '2250' only.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d59083ae-b83b-49c8-af5f-589d358dbf18)

* 8 * 4 -> 32.
* '3' is carried to 'c'.
* multiple of '4' will be **even** only.
* 4 * c -> even.
* 4 * c + 3 -> odd. [even + odd -> odd]
* So 'b' is **odd**. 'b' has '3' possibilities, 'b' can be '0 or 1 or 2' because we know that the no. cannot be more than '2250', so the max. value of 'b' is '2' only.
* As 'b' is **odd** and 'b' can be '0 or 1 or 2'. Therefore,
* b = 1. [1 -> odd, 0,2 -> even]

* c = 2 or 7

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a62583d-afa6-4122-bdb1-57c4e40d7ee6)

* If 'c = 2' then,
* 4 * 2 + 3 -> 11
* 4 * 1 + 1 -> 5
* c = 5
* We are getting two different values of 'c' which are '2 and 5'. This is not possible, so 'c = 2' assumption is **wrong**. Therefore,
* c = 7.
* 4 * 7 + 3 = 31
* 4 * 1 + 3 -> 7.
* This time, we are getting same values of 'c' which is '7'. So this is **correct**, so 'c=7'.

2) If the multiplication of '2' different nos is '1' then the nos are either '3 and 7' or '7 and 1'.

* 3 * 7 or 7 * 3 -> ends in '1'. 
* 101 -> Prime no, not divisible by either '3 or 7'.
* '201' is a multiple of '3'.
* '301' is a multiple of '7'.
* In the question, it is mentioned that all the letters are **unique nos**. [Logic]
* So in '301', we can see that 'E and F' both are having '3' as their number, which is not distinct numbers. So '301' is **wrong**. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee529440-9c83-4592-96e4-d9be53916a7f)

* There is no point in thinking in terms of **multiplication of '3'** because we want a '2' digit no. for 'DE' and the nos are starting from '401'. [Logic]

* This is not possible.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63e1573d-d8db-4d89-87e1-e4860721b454)

* B * O = O
* B cannot be '0,1,5,6' because,
* 0 * 0 = 0 
* 1 * 1 = 1 
* 5 * 5 = 5
* 6 * 6 = 6
* It means that 'B and Y' have the **same no**, which is not possible as it is stated in the question that all of the **letters** are of **distinct numbers**.   

4) If 'A * A = A' then the nos which are possible are '0,1,5,6'. [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

* This is not possible because we have seen in the previous logic that 'B' cannot be '0,1,5,6'. This is **wrong**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9d18e46-7d51-4cea-88c1-0cb358fd74dd)

* We will observe whenever there is **some repeatation**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5abe900e-8ff9-4bdc-80ca-706fb7b4531e)

* From 'B * B = B', there is **no carry** to the **next part(O)** because the result of 'B * O = O' only and nothing extra added. So the no. which can be 'B' is '3' because 'B * B = 3 * 3 = 9' and **no carry** and with '4' we will get '4 * 4 = 2' and '1' as **carry**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/162c8f14-feba-4fd6-a9de-877d3a3d4e10)

* If 'M = 2' which means that it is '20000 and something' which is not possible as the addition of the max values will only give '10000 and something'. So,
* M = 1.
* The no. has to be '10000 and something'.

* If we add '2' nos then the max. carry will be '+1' only.
* 9 + 9 -> 18 -> '1' as carry.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f078226-5e21-413a-b049-151cdb1cc5da)

* If 'R = 8' then '8 + 1 -> 9' and **no carry', so 'M' has no nos which is **not possible. So 'R = 8' is wrong.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df586fb6-b17c-41e0-b10d-67b3ef6cfd0c)

* R = 9, then '9 + 1 -> 10', '1' is the carry and it sets 'M = 1' which is **correct**.
* R = 9.
* O = 0.

* We want max. value for 'MONEY'.
* If 'N = 8' then 'P + E = 8' and '+1' as carry. We have already usedd 'R = 9 and N = 8', so we can't use '9 and 8'. We have to use '7 and 6' which will us '7 + 6 -> 13' and carry of '+1' which we wanted.
* Carry of '+5' is also not possible from the summation of '3' numbers(AMA).
* So, 'N = 8' is not possible.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f7d7f84-166a-428e-ac53-6a38f7818a92)

* If 'N = 7' then 'P + E = 17' which is not possible as '8 + 6 = 14' and then we have to do '+3' which is not possible from the summation of '3' numbers(AMA).  
* So, 'N = 7' is not possible.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43f82df4-f72f-48b3-a47d-e58a77cfa0df)

* For, N = 6 then 'P = 8 and E = 7' and we are getting a carry of '+1'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80449ebb-60d0-4d93-9005-e71d7f410236)

* 'N = 6' is not possible as we are having issue in the '+1' carry.
* 'P=7 and E = 8' and we knew that 'E' is an **even** number.

* If 'M = 8, A = 4' then '8 - 4 = 4' there is no carry then 'P = 4' and '4 - 4 = 0'. So 'D = 0'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f80590b9-4d4a-4526-a47a-5ca471bc070b)

* If 'R - Q = 0'  is only possible when 'R and Q' are consequitive nos and 'R' is **greater than 'Q'**. 'R' had given carry of '+1' to the previous no(P) then both 'R and Q' are **equal** and we will get **zero(0)**.
* Substraction of '2' different terms is '0' when '1' no. has given carry(+1) to another number.

* QD - PT.
* 60 - 59.
* '60' has given a carry to the previous no(A) then both 'QD = 59 = PT' are **equa** and we got **00**.
* Difference is of '1' only.
* 58 - 57, this is not possible because 'Q and P' will have no. '5' as their nos, which is not possible. So this is **wrong**.
* It can be '90-89', '80-79', '70-69'.

* We are replacing 'D and T' and putting their numbers.
* D - S = M
* 0 - S = M
* It has taken carry(+1) from 'A'.
* A - 1 - P = p

* Q = 2.
* P = 1.
* R = Q + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3.

* A = 5.
* Q = 3.
* P = 2.
* R = Q + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4.

* A = 7.
* Q = 4.
* P = 3.
* R = Q + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5.
* R = 5.

* 'A' gave carry of '1' to 'D' and then 'A' took carry of '1' from 'D' which is '+10'. When we take **carry**, '1' is not getting **added**, '10' is getting added. So,

* If 100 bulbs were touched normally.
* '10' bulbs changed state. '90' bulbs remained in **same** state.
* In Question '3', after the '50th' person the operation is stopped.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da8af63f-db6f-4ffd-853e-129cd4e73a66)

* For the 1st 50 bulbs they worked normally only. So, the '7' perfect square bulbs before '50' were touched **odd** no. of times.
* 64 -> 2 ^ 6 -> 7 -> odd
* But we can't have the factor '64' as it is greater than '50'. So it is '6' factors now. As it is **even** so the state remained the **same**.
* 81 -> 3 ^ 4 -> 5 -> odd
* But we can't have the factor '81' as it is greater than '50'. So it is '4' factors now. As it is **even** so the state remained the **same**.
* 100 -> 2 ^ 2 * 5 ^ 2 -> 9 -> odd
* But we can't have the factor '100' as it is greater than '50'. So it is '8' factors now. As it is **even** so the state remained the **same**.
* All of the **non-perfect squares** have **even** no. of factors. [**IMPORTANT**]

* 16 [Question] [Set] [**VERY IMPORTANT**] [Practice]
* Frequency.

* Frequency(F) can be different. We don't know the frequency. We only know the dates when the doctors visited the zones. They know some of the dates only, they don't know the middle dates.
* F = 8.
* We don't know the actual frequency.
* How we will find the frequency?
* It is also mentioned in the question is that "none of the zones were visited on consecutive days" which means that the **frequency** is **not '1'**.
* It is also mentioned that "each zone was visited atleast once in 7days which means that frequenncy is **greater than equal to '7'**.
* F <= 7.

* Zone A:-
* 1st March to 2nd April -> 32 days.
* 2nd April to 16 April -> 14 days.
* Common factor for  '32 and 14' is '2'.
* So the **possible frequency** is '2'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cd993d2-63c6-4426-9a95-3abaf81e5d2e)

* Frequency of two zones is only **equal** as mentioned in the question. So 'A and D' zones have the same frequency of '2' then the frequency of zone 'E' cannot be '2'. Hence for **Q2** the frequency of zone 'E' is '4'.
* 5th of march is **not the starting date** for zone 'E'. It is the date which the doctors have remembered.
* The frequency is '4', so the date can be '1st of march' also.
* It is no where mentioned that '5th of march' is the **starting date**. It is one of the dates that they remembered. [Logic]
* Do not assume anything. [Logic] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

* '79' is the largest prime no but we cannot remove '79'. So the next prime nos are '73 and 71'.
* Avg. of '69 and 71' is '70' only.
* So, we will remove '73'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4ced0c7-9d71-4bea-b6bc-e5a3eea84a5f)

* Example.
* The last no is a multiple of '256'.
* This is not possible because as stated in the question that they are '2' digit numbers and '256' is a '3' digit number.
* We have to keep the no. smaller.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac3100c5-6cbc-448d-9ec8-6a3c5a3d8764)

* Our range is from '10 to 99'.

* The smallest fraction can be '3/2'.
* The min. denominator can be '2' only as it is the smallest fraction. It cannot be smaller than '2'.
* Everytime 'r = 3/2' is getting multiplied.
* a = 16K -> multiple of '16'.
* We cannot take multiple of '16' because with 'a = 16', we are getting '81' as the last number. So if we multiple of '16', then the last number will be **greater than '100'** which we don't want.
* That's why we will put 'a = 16'.

* We got those '5' nos in GP.
* '6' nos are in AP.
* 5 + 6 -> 11
* Actually there was '9' numbers.
* 11 - 9 = 2.
* We will have '2' numbers which are common to AP and GP.
* '7' of them will be composite.
* So '2' nos will be prime numbers.
* We have '0' prime numbers in those '5' GP numbers.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8ced5c4-7605-4feb-9567-675217afe296)

* Prime no -> odd number.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1961af6-05f3-4896-a43c-8a1fb59037bc)

* Common difference -> 8.
* That '6' nos AP series is not possible because want '2' prime numbers as well.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dc3cb62-3d2e-451c-a555-7a5f5e8d242e)

* Common difference -> 4.
* That '6' nos AP series is not possible because all of the nos. are **even**. So no prime numbers as well.
* We want a **Common difference(CD)** whose factors are **odd** numbers.
* We wanted '2' common nos but '16 and 24' didn't work out. So we are trying '16 and 36'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/154d7614-7806-4e74-b3ec-4f4811dc2a71)

* Nos. in the AP series of '20' are all **even nos**. We want prime nos which are **odd numbers**.
* Odd factor of '20' is '5'.
* We got the '2' prime nos which we wanted and also got the '6' nos in the AP series.
* '2' nos are common also.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91d5df9e-86d5-469a-9885-d61841c766b3)

* We only want '6' nos in AP, we wrote '7' nos before.
* So, '46' is not in the AP series.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/106f7ab2-6d50-4fb9-9052-dd1d6e4004b6)

* 30 -> 5, 15, 3 -> Factors of '3'.
* Out of the '9' nos, '7' nos are **composite** which means that the rest of the '2' nos are **prime numbers**. [**IMPORTANT**]

* Normally in **exam** situations how many **cases** should we **think off**. [Logic] [**IMPORTANT**]
* Normally take around **4 to 5** cases max. during the **exam** situations. [Logic] [**IMPORTANT**]
* Dont make the **cases** messy. Don't take only '1' case. [Logic] [**IMPORTANT**]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64c7421c-a411-4c10-84f1-ce6aebc4fd5d)

* It is mentioned in the question that '2 and 5' are adjacent to each other and '3' is along with '2 and 5'.
* There is a '3' digit gap between '5 and 9'. 
* '4' is between '7 and 9'.

* It is mentioned in the question that '7' digit is at the 6th position of the password.
* It means that both of the '1 and 2' cases above are **incorrect**.
* If the starting is with '8 or 1' and the ending is with '2', that is not possible.
* Ending with '2' is not possible so we are pretty such that ending with '1' is **correct**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16f01a21-cef8-4d42-b8c7-459c7fa03efb)

* We are placing '7' at the 6th position of the password. '4' is between '7 and 9' so we have placed '4 and 9' in the different cases in different/opposite ways. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26adc520-fa29-46df-81bf-e14e33b0020f)

* It is mentioned in the question that consequitive nos cannot be adjacent to each other. So in **blue color case** we can see that '1 and 2' are djacent to each other. So that case is **wrong**.
* We will place '3' in the 9th position in 'case 3'.
* We cannot take **blue color case**, we will only take **white color case**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63da0bb1-04cf-4468-84ce-3a0f7c2d25c8)

* It is mentioned in the question that '6 and 0' are adjacent to each other.
* We cannot keep '6' in the 3rd position in 'case 3' because in 4th positio we have '5', adjacent numbers. So we will keep '0' in the 3rd position in 'case 3'.

* Any groups we will take which has only '2' nos, the **avg** of those '2' nos in that groups will be an **integer** no only, as mentioned in the question.
* It will happen when both the '2' nos in the group are either **odd or even**.

* All the nos are **multiple of '6'(6k)**. If all of the nos are **multiple of '6'(6k)** then even if we divide the nos by '2,3,4,5 or 6', in any case, we will get **integer** nos only.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76372d25-3311-47d1-ac6a-70cee13cf8f3)

* 2,3,4,5,6 -> 60.
* All of the nos are **multiple of '60'(60k)** only.
* For the value of '60', in any of the cases we will get an **integer**.
* The internal values are **multiple of '2,3,4,5 and 6'**.
* We have to satisfy all of the **cases** all at **once**.

* Any '2' nos we will take and divide it by '2' will give us an **integer**.
* Any '3' nos we will take and divide it by '3' will give us an **integer**.
* Any '4' nos we will take and divide it by '4' will give us an **integer**.
* Any '5' nos we will take and divide it by '5' will give us an **integer**.

* If '2' nos are **multiples of '60'** then the difference between the '2' nos is also a **multiple of '60'**.
* Then the difference between 'Q and R' is in the range of '160 to 195' which means the difference is '180' as it is a **multiple of '60'**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8580dfa4-2735-48ba-b3c6-156407610417)

* We don't know the order of the difference between 'Q and R', whether it is 'Q - R' or it is 'R - Q'. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a154d6b9-0c0e-40aa-9c94-2623416ad3d6)

* We know that 'Q > R' so it cannot be that 'R - Q = 180'. It is 'Q - R = 180'.
* S = P + T.
* S = 3x + T [P = 3x]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e8569a9-4333-42cc-ac50-d7f3d8884385)

* Final equation.
* '3x, 4x, 5x' are multiple of '60K'.
* '10x' is a multiple of '60K'. [10 -> 2,5]
* 'T' is a multiple of '60K'.
* '1440' is a multiple of '60K'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f95b449-14e2-4b4a-a67d-2d25d06d5c7d)

* 'x' is a multiple of '60K'.
* 10x = 10 * 60k = 600k.
* Thinking about **multiple of '600'**.
* 600k = 600 * 1 =600.
* 1440 - 600 = 840.
* We cannot have individually **more than '800'** at once.
* 840 > 800.
* So, this is **not possible**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09d3b6cc-e73d-46ce-a3b3-b20cbf7d2cf9)

* 600k = 600 * 2 1200.
* 1440 - 1200 = 240.
* 240 < 800.
* So, this is **possible**.
* 600 * 3 = 1800
* 1800 > 1440.
* So '1200' is the **only case** possible. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b13d9e33-5692-4909-bdf7-af4623f20672)

* T = 240.

* P = 3x = 360.
* Q = 5x = 600.
* R = 5x - 180 = 420.

* 21. [Question] [Set] [**VERY IMPORTANT**] [Practice]
* We need to build a kind of **matrix** here. [**IMPORTANT**]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eac488e9-dc86-42c6-9c54-d3507f7ccdae)

* In a **matrix** formation, don't fix anything **bliendly**. [Logic] [Fomula] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* We have a '6 * 4' matrix which means we are filling '6 * 4 = 24' elements in the **matrix**.
* Don't fix any of the **rows**. [Logic] [Fomula] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* After reading all of the lines in the **question** then decide what to do. For which **row**, the **question** has the **max.** info. [Logic] [Fomula] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* We have filled the wrong things and we are paying the penalty by wasting our time in solving it in a longer amount of time. [Logic] [Fomula] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* From the **start**, we don't have to take anything to our **heads**. Based on what was written on the **question**, we have to **attack** accordingly. [Logic] [Fomula] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

* We have '6' people who belong to these '4' countries.
* In any of the '2' countries there will be '2' people and in the other '2' countries there will be '1' people only.
* These is same for **language** as well.
* In any of the '2' languages there will be '2' people and in the other '2' languages there will be '1' people only.

* Every line needs to be read in-depth.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66fcc1dd-8204-4a3e-9154-68b355ba317c)

* From the 2nd statement we can see that, 'Q' definitely doesn't work in company 'J'.
* 'a, b and c' -> some country currently unknown.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b5f81f1-6a00-4122-8b78-bfd9b4f0dd29)

* There are '2 a' and 'a' is **south africa** because it cannot be **france**. 'Q' is already from **france** as mentioned in the **question**. So if 'a' is **france** then there will be '3' people from **france**. So 'a' cannot be **france** and it is **south africa**.
* a = **south africa(SA)**.
* Now we have to find the connecting points with or from **south africa(SA)** to solve it **easier/faster**.
* We found that **SA** people don't know **german**. So we cross out **german** as a **lang** for 'U'. 'R' already had a **lang**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1d30561-6f62-4481-9c32-bdc21fb4799d)

* As 'R' has **lang** as **polish** already and 'R' is from 'SA'. 'U' is also from 'SA' so 'U' cannot have **lang** as **polish** as it is mentioned in the question that **same country people cannot have the same language**.
* 'P' cannot have 'J' as company because 'J' company's people speak **german** but 'P' doesn't speak **german**.
* 'Q' cannot have 'J' as it is mentioned in the question that 'Q' is not from the company 'J'.
* 'U' cannot be from 'J' as 'U' cannot speak **german** and people from company 'J' can speak **german**.
* Already 'Q' has **lang** as **german** and country as **france**. 'S' has **lang** as **german** already, so 'S' **cannot** have country as **france** as mentioned in the question that **same people having the same language cannot have same country**. 
* Finally, 'S' takes 'J' and the **lang** of 'S' is **german**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/762eb473-04e4-4930-b2ec-72f27b7fb6f9)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3424e39e-8586-47bc-aa46-8ea2e621670f)

* We have filled '4' countries.
* As 'S' cannot have 'france' so the only other option is **russia**.
* So the **country** of **S** is **russia**.
* We are left with 'P' only.
* So the **country** of **P** is **france**.
* We have already filled **german** as a **lang** for '2' people. We cannot do more.
* We cannot fill **H -> English** in **Q and T**. We can in **P and U**.
* We cannot fill **M -> polish** in **Q,T and U**. We can in **P** only.
* So, **company** of 'P' is 'M' and the **lang** of 'P' is **polish**.
* We can put **H -> English** at **U** only.

* **Other pilot** who flew to 10000 feet used an **eagle** jet.
* 'L' didn't use an **eagle** jet.
* Lowest -> 10000 swirls.
* 70000/100 = 700.
* Winner(Rank 1) = 700 + 500 = 1200 swirls.
* 'M' is not 'Rank 1'.

* We are done with all of the points in the set.
* It is mentioned in the question that 'J and K' are not the **winner**.
* 'L' did the **lowest height** so it is also not the **winner**. Even if we give the highest no. of swirls which is '8' to 'L' then also the no. of swirls will be '800' only.
* No. of swirls for the **winner** is '1200'. So 'L' is not a **winner**.
* 'J, K, L, M' are not the **winner**. So 'N' is only left.
* 'N' is the **winner**.
* 'N' has '1200' swirls.

* 70000 * 3 = 210000. 
* '210000' is not divisible by '1200'.
* 'M' does not have jet as **woodpicker**.
* Only left are 'J, N and L' but 'N' is the **winner** so 'N' cannot be **woodpicker**.
* We can fix **Eagle -> 10000** in 'J' only. We cannot put it anywhere else.
* 'J' is **Eagle -> 10000**.
* Only left is 'L'. So,
* 'L' is the **woodpicker**.
* If **woodpicker** is 'x' height then the **winner** is '3x' height.
* x = 10000, winner = 3x = 30000.
* 'N' height is '30000'.

* 30000/100 = 300.
* 1200/300 = 4.
* '4' per 100 feet.
* 'N' is a category 'C' pilot.
* We know that the **winner** which is 'N' cannot have a **jet** of 'eagle or vulture'. So 'M' has a jet of **vulture** because 'J' has already taken **eagle**.
* 'N' has a jet of **penguin**.

* 70000/100 = 700
* 700/700 = 1 swirl per 100 feet -> category 'A'.

* With '50000' we will get '2' as '2' can divide '50000'.
* We are left with '2,6 and 8'.
* 50000/100 = 500
* 500 * 2 =1000 swirls.
* 500 * 6 = 3000 swirlss.
* 500 * 8 = 4000 swirlss.
* '3000 and 4000' swirls are not possible because the winner had '1200' swirls.

* We are sure that with '50000' we can fit '2'. So it is of category 'B'.
* We are left with '6 and 8'.

* We know that **woodpicker** has the **lowest no. of swirls**.  'M' is the **woodpicker**, so it would have the lowest no. of swirls which is '600'.
* 'L' is '600'.
