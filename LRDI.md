* For **7**, we will pick **1 coin** and we are left with **6 coins**. Chanchal will pick which ever no of coins be it **1, 2, 3 or 4**, we can pick **4, 3, 2, 1** no. of coins respectively so that there is **1 coin** left which she has to pick and thus **loose** the game. [Logic] [Explaination] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* For **8** also it is **same** as **7** only. [Logic] [Explaination] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* **7 and 8** are **winning** nos for me.

* **5** is the no that is **controlling** the game. It is called as **controlling factor**. [**VERY IMPORTANT**] [Logic]
* Min -> 1, Max -> 4
* Controlling factor(CF) -> Min + Max -> 1 + 4 -> 5.  [**VERY IMPORTANT**] [Formula]

* **1** was the **lossing no** after that it was **6** after that it was **11**. They are Lossing nos.
* After a **difference of '5'** we are getting **lossing nos**.
* 11 -> 16 -> 21.

* These are **lossing** nos only.
* 13 * 97 -> 1261.
* As **1263** is one of the **lossing** nos so **1263** is the **answer**.

* The value of **x** is **9** only. We cannot have **x = 10**. So it is **9, 8 and 7**.
* The sum of **x** is **9 + 8 + 7 -> 24**. x = 24.
