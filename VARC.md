2) Gigo is an elephant.

* Valid Inference -> Gigo is black. [**IMPORTANT**] [Example].

1) All dogs are mammels
2) Gigo is a mammels

* Invalid Inference -> Gigo is a dog. [**IMPORTANT**] [Example]
* **Sound** inference is a **valid inference**, which has **true** premises. [**IMPORTANT**]
* Gigo is an elephant -> Valid inference but not a **sound** inference. [**IMPORTANT**] [Example]
* **Sound** inference also looks at the **truth** of the premises.
* For a **lawyer** in a court room they have to create **valid inference** as well as **sound** inference. 
* We don't have to check whatever is given in the **passage** is **True or not**. That we don't have to check. We will assume whatever is given in the passage is **True**. [**VERY IMPORTANT**.

### Assumption Questions

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/MBA/assets/54589605/31edec8d-501b-48c0-9b8a-576bd3b51ce3)

* Assumption
* Batman is human -> Premise
* Therefore, batman is mortal -> Conclusion.
* Humans are mortal -> Necessary statements -> Assumptions.
* **Assumptions** are things that are **necessary** for an **argument** to make sense.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/MBA/assets/54589605/709e0e5f-76b7-4cb8-9794-b692c2cbb099)

* Necessary statements != sufficient statements.
* != -> not equal to.
* They are not the **same**.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/MBA/assets/54589605/2ebaf057-1c33-4535-ab36-f28ef93d5a86)

* Inference -> Drawing conclusions.
* Batman is human -> From these statement we are **infering** that **Batman is mortal**. [Example]
* "Go Home" -> We are assuming that the person has a home. We are assuming that the person is not deaf. We are assuming that the person understands english.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/MBA/assets/54589605/ef98f454-b020-44e0-9c2b-bf4a28cda423)

* Or we can say that the **assumption** was a **premise** that was needed for this particular **argument**. It protects the **argument**. It is like a necessary **protection** needed to protect the **argument**,
