* [Revision] [Summary] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef827945-3b3b-4811-92ad-5744b62deec1)

* Example.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37f4045a-92fd-4518-a2f5-78fdbf218d41)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/189743f9-bd9d-4430-8a0c-1e1f0ef6dc17)

* Every **mod** has an **origin**.
* Whenever the inner value of **mod** is **'0'** then that is called as the **origin of the mod**.
* x = 3 -> Origin of mod.
* 3 + 10 -> 13
* 3 - 10 -> -7
* |x - a| = k. [Distance Approach]
* a -> origin of the mod.
* x = -k OR +k.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cd8d2a4-0350-440c-bae4-cb696bb6f026)

* As there are '2' modulus so we will have '2' origins.
* |x - 5| -> 5
* |x - 15| -> 15
* 15 - 5 -> 10.
* Combined distance -> 20.
* (A + B)'s Combined distance -> 10.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54f448b0-1b70-4ffb-bc35-cae6e4f8230d)

* For the Combined distance to be '20', 'A and B' has to meet **outside**.
* If 'A' goes to 'B' -> Distance is '10'.
* If 'B' goes to 'A' -> Distance is '10'.
* We want a **common point** because in both the mods, the **origin** is the **same(x)**.
* **common point** -> A and B -> 5 each.
* A -> 10 -> 5 -> 15
* B -> 0 -> 5 -> 5
* A + B -> 15 + 5 -> 20. [Ans]
* 20 - 5 -> 15
* 20 - 15 -> 5.

* [Question]
* Origin -> Negative to Positive.
* |x + 4| -> -4.
* The sum of the '4' origins is '18' only.
* If everyone meets at 'A' place -> 4 + 7 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 - 4 -> 23
* If everyone meets at 'B' place -> 7 + 4 + 0 + 4 -> 15
* If everyone meets at 'C' place -> 3 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 -> 15
* If everyone meets at 'D' place -> 0 + 3 + 7 + 7 + 4 -> 21
* The value of the **middle points** will be the **same**. [**IMPORTANT**]
* If we go beyond 'D' then it will be '21+' or more than '21'. So the answer is not there also as we want '18'.

* If we go beyond 'A' then it will be '23+' or more than '23'. So the answer is not there also as we want '18'.
* If 'B and C' are '15' which means that between 'B and C', we will get '15' only as seen in the **last/previous** question. So the answer is not there also as we want '18'.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8dedcf96-14ec-41fa-a4cd-7368b3f3ea16)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3587a2e1-0edf-456c-a55d-eb24762c8b9d)

* We will get '18' between 'A and B' which is from '23 to 15' and we will get '18' between 'C and D' which is from '15 to 21'
* A + D -> 4 + 7 -> 11.
* We have to get the sum as '18'.
* We have to get 'B + C = 7'.
* 'B' went to 'C' -> 7 - 4 -> 3.
* We have '3' distance left, so both 'B and C' will travel '1.5' distance.
* B -> 4 + 1.5 -> 5.5
* C -> 1.5
* B + C -> 5.5 + 1.5 -> 7.
* x = 5.5

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3fc9b20-a0b7-4b93-9422-56730c30ec0d)

* The **sign** gets **reversed**. The greater than sign becomes a less than sign as we multiplied with '-2'.

* This is for **multiple and divide** only, when we are taking some value be it '2, -2 or x' across the inequality, we have to be **100% sure** that it is a **positive or negative** value, cannot be an **ambigious value**. [**VERY IMPORTANT**] [Formula] [Concept]
* Positive -> No sign change.
* Negative -> Sign change.

* Separate the **even powers** first. [Example]
* Any even power will always be positive. We can freely send them across the **inequality** without any problem.
* **Zero(0)** multipled by any positive no. is **Zero(0)**. **Zero(0)** divided by any positive no. is also **Zero(0)**.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/617b60ae-abe0-48a1-896b-c45f75b45fc1)

* We have to be **careful** about the terms which had **even powers** and are **completely vanished** which is **(x - 2)** here.
* We will give special treatment to **(x - 2)**.
* Critical point of **(x - 2)**:-
* x - 2 = 0
* x = 2.
* (x - 2) ^ 100 -> 0>=0 -> This is always **True**.

* Denominator cannot be '0'. '7' should not be included in the **answer**.

* (x - 2) ^ 100 -> Always positive -> So we can easily remove it.
* We have to check the critical point of **(x - 2)**, if it should be included in the answer or not.
* x - 2 = 0
* x = 2
* x - 2 >= 0 -> 2 - 2 >= 0 -> 0 >= 0.
* It is **True**.
* So in the **answer** we should put **x = 2**.

2) Under-root value is **negative**. Roots are **imaginary**. For no value of 'x' we can **cut or merge** it. Graph will never cut x-axis.

* The 'y' is always **positive**. This is **important** for quadratic.
* y > 0.
* The graph is always **positive**.

* (x + 2) ^ 2, (x - 2) ^ 2 -> Even powers -> Both are positive -> remove them.
* 2x - 5 = 0
* x = 2.5
* x * (2x - 5)(x + 2)(x - 2) -> It is in the form of **(x - a) * (x - b)**. [Formula] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* So we will start from **right side** and we will put **positive** on the 1st part and then alternately put **positive and negative** on the next parts. [Formula] [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d72b029-cec5-4ec6-bd9e-b46cd8367fc4)

* We know that in the **denominator** part of the question we have **x ^ 2 - 4** and specifically **x ^ 2**, so if we put **x = 2** then the denominator will be **'0'**. [Logic]
* x ^ 2 - 4 -> 2 ^ 2 - 4 -> 0.
* So **x = 2** should be **excluded** from the **answer**. We will put **small bracket** for '2' in the **answer**. [Logic]

* Inequality. [Formula] [**VERY IMPORTANT**] [Concept]
* For all the positive real nos -> Arithmetic mean(AM) >= Geometric mean(GM) >= Harmonic mean(HM) -> It is **always True**.
* Equality sign holds -> only for equal numbers.
* We are sure that the **nos. are not equal** -> AM > GM > HM -> remove those **equality signs**.
