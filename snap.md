* Assumption '1' -> It is now **killed**.
* Assumption '1' -> Proper assumption.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6954f0b2-116c-47e3-8413-523a35277811)

* 'B' cannot come in top shelf because 'G' comes above 'B'.
* If 'D' is coming then 'E' has to come with 'D' also.
* 'C' cannot come in the top shelf because 'C' comes with only '1' item and we know that 4th shelf has only '1' item on it. So top shelf has to have '2' items on it.
